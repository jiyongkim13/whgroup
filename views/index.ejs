                  <p dir="ltr">CREATION STORIES</p><br><p dir="ltr">Grace: I’ll start off by reading my question…</p><p dir="ltr">In three of the four creation stories-- the Bamoko story, “Guest Voices: Shona Creation Story,” and Genesis 1, humans were not the main character while in "La Tradition," humans, specifically that people group, were the subject. What do each of the stories' main characters tell us about how the audience is supposed to see themselves and the world around them-- i.e. identity, purpose, value. (Grace Shubin)</p><p dir="ltr">Grace: Jusang?</p><p dir="ltr">Jusang: What I’d like to contribute is to divide it into two distinct groups, the Shona and Genesis--these are creation stories where the main characters weren’t human, while in “La Tradition” the main characters were human. For the first part, in terms of what the audience is supposed to see about the world around them, with the first group, the non-human entities, there’s the concept of “if you can’t see it, it’s more powerful, you’re scared of what you don’t know.” Maybe it was meant for a younger demographic to instill awe and fear into them, and to see themselves and the world around them as a world created by powers greater than themselves. And this gives them a sort of respect in all ways of life. Perhaps that was meant as a lesson of that sort. As for “La Tradition,” I think it’s a history of sorts, with people. It seems more realistic or at least more relatable since humans are the main characters; they can serve as lessons or recounts of painful memories, and it might be intended to be listened to by future leaders of the community, who would learn from their history and see the world around them as something more hostile, something they had to break-through and survive in order to not repeat the mistakes or tragedies of the past. However, something interesting, even within “La Tradition,” when they first described the Europeans, they called them the Vumbi, the returning spirits. They’re not human characters either. So even in that sense, there’s even a slight element of unseen fear to that, though that could serve as maybe stimuli to make the white men seem more scary or hostile. That’s what I got so far from your question.</p><p dir="ltr">Grace: Thank you, no one has their hand raised right now, and if we don’t have anybody else we can move onto the next question. Ah, OK. Sorry if I mispronounce it, Simena?</p><p dir="ltr">Simena: Jusang raised an interesting point about the whites. And right after they mention them being compared to ghosts, there’s a passage of a prayer. When I first read it, it kind of resonated as if they were praying to the whites, they were seeing them as spirits, and they were&nbsp; putting them on a pedestal and not seeing them as equal humans. Putting more fear into them.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Grace: Thank you. Sua?</p><p dir="ltr">Sua: About the prayer, I actually thought that… it says that “after the arrival of whites, nothing but wars and misery” were brought up. And, actually, apart from that the whites brought agriculture and that brought religion to them. I think this correlation of factors is interesting. From the arrival of the whites, the presence of religion, the consciousness that there might be a God that might help us harvest more food. That’s an interesting part, not from the beginning.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Grace: Thank you, Kevin?</p><p dir="ltr">Kevin: You can call me Kevin. All of these prayer things, and Gods and supernatural elements, someone mentioned earlier that… that these things that these people don’t understand, they try to describe it as something supernatural and godly. Why are there stars in the sky? Oh, it’s because they had to return to the sky, that’s what God ordered. They tried to explain these unexplainable phenomena through these myths. From the perspective of African peoples, white people arriving in scary boats must have been extremely alien and unfamiliar, which is why they compared them to great spirits, Gods and ghosts. But this is a work of history, a documentation. At first sight, they looked like scary Gods or ghosts, but in hindsight, when we look back on what they did to us, they’re not ghosts. They’re misery and war. I feel like the story documents the first impression of these white people but also makes a comment on what we know now, what we reflect back on.</p><p dir="ltr">Grace: Thank you, I’ll give a few more seconds. Ah, OK. Eugene, go ahead.</p><p dir="ltr">Eugene: To add to what Kevin said. I think that sums up the nature of first encounters. At first, whoever you’re meeting seems foreign and unnatural, and even supernatural as the text describes… and it also reminded me of the secondary text, how Europeans saw Africans as “the other”--the whole continent itself as a “paradigm of difference,” I think it was it called. I think the description of the encounter sums up the nature of that first contact.</p><p dir="ltr">Grace: Thank you, if there’s nobody else, last call for more comments… OK, then I think we can move on to the next question. All right, OK, thank you.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: Yeah, thank you Grace. My question was…About the prayer… that after the arrival of the whites, apart from the war and misery, the whites also brought agriculture and religion. I think the correlation between these factors are interesting.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the creation stories explicitly mention 'God' as the first creator, but in some there is no mention about the creator, or even a human being (especially having a profession of blacksmith) appear as a pioneer. What does the difference of the first creator/pioneer between the stories indicate? (Sua)</p><br><p dir="ltr">[Denton: For some reason, my changes aren’t being saved… first time that’s ever happened on my end… I’ll go back to the recording and re-transcribe what you’ve been saying.]&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: I might be going too far, but I think it indicates how people perceive god. I think when we have the author say ‘God created these’ they are also stating that there is a ‘creator god’ and the creator god is also the controller of things. But there are also societies which believes that a god is not a creator and controller of all things but a ‘stimulator’, and the role of the god becomes that of a ‘starter’, not an omnipotent god whom we pray to. Perhaps there is a difference in how they perceive gods.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: Kyeyoung said there may be a difference in the perception of gods, whether their role is the controller of all things or their role is limited. Next, Annet, please?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Annet: I feel like they had all the things that they did not know where they came from, like their rivers, the animals. So they started creating stories in which they believe that there has to be a creator for all these things to exist. But after they started evolving, and started creating things by themselves they had new stories to tell. There can be new protagonists for their own stories, such as a blacksmith, a chief… who told us how to harvest and collect food. They had more stories to tell and they wanted to share the experiences.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: The God was created by the need of possible civilization</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: I think what Annet said about the creation of stories was insightful. It relates to the difference you talked about. Both talk about creation, but of different things. When you talk about god, god created the world around us, like the plant, animals, ecosystem, and everything we live on. But the story of the Blacksmith talks about the creation of a new lifestyle, not the creation of the world. So both of them are material, but even before the Blacksmith there was the story of the ancestors arriving at the planes. The story of the Blacksmith does not necessarily relate to the creation of the world and the people, compared to the ones with deities in it. It focuses on how the blacksmith brought technology like smithing and weaving that defines the lifestyle of people. That is the big distinction.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Sua: Great, creation of a new lifestyle. Next, Zo?</p><p dir="ltr">Zo: I want to talk about what Jusang said, about what different people worship. As for Christians, with the Bible, they needed a god who created everything around them. But for these people, it was enough for them to worship their ancestors who came to this land and started this new life. The blacksmith [story] is talking about their fathers, and those fathers were praying to spirits. For them it was all about their ancestors who brought this new life. Like what Jusang said.</p><p dir="ltr">Sua: Connection to a new history, maybe. Kevin, please?</p><p dir="ltr">Kevin: The thing about history... I think that there is a difference between a story, a parable, and a documentation of history. The key difference between a god and magical character and a human character is that these people simply know things. They know that this metal work, that was brought by this person, so they did not have to use magic and mythology to explain where it came from. The key difference between the creation story and the Blacksmith story.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">That said, I think they are also similar in a way that they try to memorialize these influential figures, as if they are godly beings. It’s like you are not Jesus but you are Moses. They preserve their deeds and achievements in documentation. They are describing heroes: that arrived, and he did these…</p><p dir="ltr">Sua: Yes, that’s a new approach. Assessing the value of characters… Maybe last, Jessica?</p><p dir="ltr">Jessica: In my personal thoughts, I think the expression of god itself, that some stories reveal gods superficially and some are not, cannot be the main difference between the stories. It’s because at that time, there was no explicit expression on what to call the supernatural power. So I think the expression may be different within the society, that does not demonstrate the difference between societies, and even though the demonstrations are different, I can identify a similar soul that they are trying to describe humans into a supernatural thing. It can be a blacksmith, a god, or other nature. They want to stress that humans are special beings that we can have dominance over nature and the creatures. Despite the differences, we can focus on the similar soul of what the stories are telling about.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Sua: Great. That’s a new interpretation. Although they said blacksmith in the story, it may not be the main point of the differences. Apart from that, does anyone have a last comment?</p><p dir="ltr">Professor Denton: This will be the last call because I am going to jump in. Anybody have something to say quickly to the last question or to anything that you’d like to contribute quickly before I jump in with a couple of closing remarks?</p><p dir="ltr">Okay. I’ll jump in with the closing remarks. I’m not going to recap on your last remarks because for some reason, as you can see on the google doc, this is the first time ever for me that my google doc won’t save and it would keep reloading. But I have audio recordings, with the help of my TA, I’m going to have her retranscribe the places I missed. Usually what I do is that I would scroll back up and I pay attention to the points that I wanted to make, and when I really have an idea that I want to contribute, I will write on the transcript in italics. If you are the moderator, ignore it. It’s really just there for me, and if others want to see it, then it’s ok, but it’s not something for you to do or know about. If I want to communicate to a moderator or a student I will do that through a private message on Zoom chat. So if I feel like maybe I can give you some helpful information or you want quick feedback, I can intervene that way.</p><p dir="ltr">But I feel like this is a good, really great start. I feel like you have a sense of what we’re trying to do here. And we got about half-way. We did not have as much time to get everybody speaking, but I think you can see what that would look like.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">But to answer maybe one of the questions you guys had, like Minsoo or Kyeyoung’s question, ‘How much importance should we give to creation stories, what kind of values?’ ‘Why are we starting with creation stories?’ I want to answer that part. Why I chose to begin where we have begun, and to reveal a little bit about what the three audio clips were.</p><p dir="ltr">The first one you heard on Tuesday was --- creation oratorio.

                    The Shona creation story seems to raise the question: is it right to disobey the order of God? While Mwedzi was rewarded with another companion after returning Hweva to the sky per God’s instructions, he was punished for not returning Venekatsvimborume as promised, with the birth of “lions, scorpions, and other predators” . This story initially seemed like a lesson intended to show the consequences of defying God whilst explaining creation. However, there is a surprising element that casts doubt on if Mwedzi had been “punished”. While the predators hunt herbivores, this also helps to keep the ecosystem in check by limiting the latter’s overpopulation. While this concept may perhaps have not been crucially considered at the time, or even ignored, the author may have also been aware of the previously-explained ecological importance of the animals that lived alongside them. If the latter case is true, Mwedzi and Venekatsvimborume’s spawn may also have been seen as necessary.<br><br>
                    
                    In relation to the excerpt from Genesis, God in the Bible had not created the animals as punishment; it states that after creating them, “God saw that it was good” . There was no distinction made between carnivores and herbivores. Although there was no case of disobedience shown in the excerpt, this concept of benevolent creation may have also been shared by the previous story, in which case the predators would have been a boon. Perhaps both, being lessons as well as stories about the power of omnipotent beings, were meant to stir certain emotions in uncontrollable, rebellious youths, which may be fear in the Shona creation story and admiration in Genesis.<br><br>

                  <b>Sunjata / Herodotus Comparison</b></h3><b><br></b><p dir="ltr">-Image of a King?</p><p dir="ltr">Jusang: Reading his question…</p><p dir="ltr">The king of the Ethiopians in Herodotus is described to almost immediately recognize the Fish-eaters' true identity as spies, while Sunjata in Bamba Suso's story seems to either not realize the intent of the griots to exploit him or tolerate them doing so. What kind of image of a king does each source intend to introduce to their respective audiences? (Jusang)</p><p dir="ltr">Jusang: Any thoughts? Eugene?</p><p dir="ltr">Eugene: This is not exactly a direct answer to your question, but what I thought was odd or interesting was that while Herodotus had a clear resolution--at least to me--I thought the text ending of Sunjata was incomplete, no clear resolution, I don’t know if that’s just my own opinion. That for me was a little confusing.</p><p dir="ltr">Jusang: Interesting observations, Kevin?</p><p dir="ltr">Kevin: The Fish-Eaters and griots, betraying the king and how the king reacts. In Herodotus, how the King recognized they were spies immediately gave m the impression that the king was astute, aware and clever. But in Sunjata, physical strength was more valued. The person’s size and strength. Instead of something like knowledge or intelligence, Sunjata is a more--how should I put it?--kind individual. How he cares ofr his mother. He’s a very humble person. He rejects the wealth and only takes the griots. It emphasizes the different values of cultures and what they prioritize.</p><p dir="ltr">Jusang: Anusha?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Anusha: Might be similar to what Kevin said. The point of the Sunjata story is to show how he was a weak person who transformed into a strong person. But in Herodotus, it doesn’t explicitly say that, but I’m assuming that the person who told Herodotus this story was Ethiopian. Because of how much better they portrayed the Ethiopians versus the spies. But this is hearsay, we don’t know how true it is. They obviously respect the Ethiopian king and claim that he recognized them as a spy. THat’s my interpretation.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Jusang: Certainly could be bias in the portrayal as well. Sua?</p><p dir="ltr">Sua: I think the stories are showing the traits that a leader of a tribe, state, people, should have. The Ethiopian king is wise. He knows everything. You can see that through the personality of the king. This representation of the king is something we should be aware of. An individual cannot represent all of the tribe, or his people, it might be a simplification of the community. This description of kings and queens is also something we should be aware of. History is the story of the elite.</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: I agree with what Anusha said and the weakness to strength, and then in Herodotus, the superiority of the Ethiopian king to Cambyses.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Jusang: Any other answers? If there are none, I’ll hand over the moderating to the next person.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Min Soo: I don’t think we need to open a discussion about my question, but before moving on to Grace’s question, I thought I’d explain my thoughts about my question:&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">What are some similarities and differences between Sunjata and the Ethiopian king as leaders? (Min Soo)</p><p dir="ltr">Min Soo: I thought the similarity between Sunjata and the Ethiopian king was that they were figures whose priority was to defend, rather than attack. The end of the Sunjata story, as we see it, is going into exile. Not the image of a powerful king who conquers. He sticks with his griot, defends his mother. Similar to the Ethiopian king. I thought I’d say that and move on to Grace’s question. Reading the next question…</p><p dir="ltr">--Story or legend vs. historical account… but enchantment in both?</p><p dir="ltr">The style of Sunjata and Herodotus' account are different in terms that one is told as a story or legend but the other is a historical account that asserts its verity through first-hand accounts. Both record moments of magic or magic-like things like the water that the Ethiopians use. Would the style of these two texts produce different effects on the audiences of their time in terms of belief and reliability? In addition, should modern readers view or value these texts any differently from each other? (Grace)</p><p dir="ltr">Min Soo: Any thoughts? Ali?</p><p dir="ltr">Ali: So, it is really interesting how in the past, these historical events, or mythical events, were viewed through a religious lens. It’s a sign of the times. I don’t think that it takes away from the reliability or veracity of these sources. The authors at the time, I’m assuming, accepted these supernatural stories that weren’t totally grounded in science and reliaty, but they had aspects of real life intertwined in them. Modern readers can use these stories to know about these people and understand their thought processes and ideologies. How they took religion and uspernatural stories seriously. These are my thoughts.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Min Soo: So, despite being different types of sources, they’re both representative of different cultures and peoples.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Annet: Something interesting to me in the Sunjata graphic novel was how they portrayed magic beings as female. Sunjata’s mother became a buffalo because she was mad, the other performs dark magic to take him out of the picture. But it was interesting for me that they show women with these powers. But at the beginning of the graphic novel, Sunjata’s uncle doesn’t think that women can have a piece of the kingdom, even if they have those magical powers, or next to the throne because their father died.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Min Soo: The women have magic but they’re not seen as having the same status as the men. Quite interesting. Nabi?</p><p dir="ltr">Nabi: In my point of view, the audience of these two works are totally different. Sunjata is intended for an audience, or a specific community, might include things that aren’t true. [missed some of that, a little hard to hear] . . . bUt if you talk about the other work, I can say that it’s more objective. More detailed. Herodotus used the exact example of evidence from people. I guess there can be some differences between the messages that were intended.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Min Soo: So, the difference in the intended audience makes the Sunjata epic more supernatural, HErodotus more grounded in reality. Kevin?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Kevin: This isn’t related. But the talk about women with magic reminded me of the relationship between women and supernatural elements in history. In the comic book, when the woman turned into a boar, it reminded me of witch hunting. Women who are seen to have strange powers, thought of as something scary and evil. Or even Medea, Greek story. Maybe nothing to do with Herodotus. These societies where when a man is big and powerful, they’re respected, but when women are strong and powerful, they’re objects of fear. They turn into boars.</p><p dir="ltr">Min Soo: Zo?</p><p dir="ltr">Zo: Even though the Herodotus stories are counted as historical accounts, they’re still written based on hearsay. We can’t really rely on it. On its authenticity. About the enchantment, I think it’s the writer’s style of writing to make it more entertaining. Not interesting to write it about it “as it happened,” but in order to attract the readers’ or audience’s interest, they use the magical and supernatural. I don’t think we should put a high focus on those supernatural events.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Min Soo: So for the purpose of entertainment, there are slightly less realistic elements. Myung Hyun?</p><p dir="ltr">Myung Hyun: I think that a big difference is that the Sunjata text relies on the griots. It depends on whose character--whether it's Sunjata or the antagonist--that will change the focus. When we hear the story of griots from Sunjata, his behavior can be protected and embellished. One of the differences in the comic book &amp; the epic, the comic book is more focused on the disabled behavior. But in the story, he refuses to stand up. He spontaneously did something. I think those points can be interesting. Seeing various styles of stories or historical accounts can be different.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Min Soo: So adding to the supernatural elements, the role of the griots makes a difference in how Sunjata is portrayed.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Se Hyee: The enchantment stuff is natural. Because he got his account through hearsay, through this oral tradition, makes sense, but the audience is different and that written text might have been received more critically than the oral tradition of Sunjata.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Min Soo: Kyeyoung?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: I want to add more to the difference between the two documents about the griots. The comic book has a more traditional view of the griots, they’re advisers, they support the king in every way. But in the oral tradition, we have the griot being materialistic. They want him to die. They also serve a good purpose, because they’re able to say what the other people could not. They could say that Sunjata was stealing when everyone else was afraid. Their acts are in speaking out, in a good way, of course, but the oral transcription shows how the griots aren’t always the good guys. More natural that they be portrayed that way.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Min Soo: Thank you for that. Does anyone else have anything more to add? In that case, I think we can move on to the next question. Kyeyoung?</p><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: This was my discussion question:&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr">Sunjata</h3><p dir="ltr">--The oral account vs. the graphic novel vs. the film vs. the YouTube video that I played in class on Tuesday morning</p><p dir="ltr">Does the medium (comic book and book [transcribed oral account]) influence the story? Was it an intentional choice that the antagonists in the "Sunjata" text and the Sunjata comic book differ, and if it does, what does this signify? (Kyeyoung)</p><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: OK, cool, Jacqueline?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Jacqueline: I would like to answer the first part of your question. Where you’re talking about the medium or the nature of the sources. It makes a pretty significant influence on the story. When I first read the epic, I was more inclined to think that the plot was more focused on Sunjata’s tension with his brothers. Making him out to be somebody weaker, then getting the help of his mother to stand. In the comic, though, I feel like there was less focus on tension with his brothers. The comic focused more on Sunjata as the hero. Comic books, like Marvel or superhero books, there’s some sort of protagonist as a powerful figure. So when I read the comic, that’s what I realized. That was the big difference between the two stories. Then the part where the woman turned into a boar. That was a more exaggerated part of the storyline.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: A lot of things pointed out here, the comics, superheroes, the brothers’ relationship, and the boar. And Ali?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Ali: I have similar ideas as Jacqueline. The graphic novel says, in the beginning, that it’s based on the stories of the traditional storytellers of West Africa. The publisher just wants to sell. Could be heavily based on entertainment, more than on the information or spreading the tale of Sunjata. The oral story was made more to preserve the culture, to make sure that it lives on for the following generations. The boars, the nine witches, those things make me think that the comic book took some liberties in adapting the story.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: We now have this talk about purpose. For the comic book, maybe more about entertainment for the other, about preserving the culture.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Zo: From my experience, and in our Mongolian literature, the difference between oral and written, the oral includes more of the supernatural, mythical. It doesn’t have a single author. It’s hearsay. People tell the stories to each other, we don’t know the author, we can’t trust its authenticity. That’s why the oral texts include more of these supernatural elements than written texts, where there’s only one author, and can’t be reorganized or rewritten. Those are more realistic and reliable.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: This was interesting as well, Sua?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Sua: Yeah, I want to focus on the comic books and films, how we’re passing on these histories in our way, our modern way. It lowers the bar of interest, makes it more accessible to people who aren’t interested in history. Read it as a story, find out that it’s history. In our far away future, these comic books and films could be viewed as how WE see Herodotus and these Egyptian drawings. It’s interesting to see how we serve history.</p><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: An extension of the time element. We have this present model of looking at the previous text. Eugene?</p><p dir="ltr">Eugene: I felt that the style of the narrative in the comic book was more familiar, than the Sunjata epic, it felt more “Western” in its sense of narrative. That’s what made it familiar. But the text is less familiar, in a West African tradition. In addition to the style of the narrative. On the first page, it depicts Sunjata wearing these pants, but I don’t think that those kinds of pants were traditional clothing there. Maybe robes or things you would see in North Africa. The pants felt more like a Marvel superhero illustration.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Eugene just pointed out our perspective in seeing the comic book, influenced by Western perceptions, we’re familiar with those. Kevin?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Kevin: So, my impression of the comic book. What was the most interesting was how much it reminded me of the traditional superhero genre, origin story, how they’re born, how they get their powers. To the traditional comic book audience, west Africa is an unfamiliar setting. To the unaware or uneducated, this West AFrica might seem like Krypton or where Wonderwoman is from. Reading those kinds of comic books, where an alien foreigner is in this fantastical world. I’m not a fan of this kind of approach, but that’s the impression that I got.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Kevin pointed out more of those themes. Jusang?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Jusang: Perhaps another difference between the two are the griots themselves. The comic book is a westernized and possibly younger audience, this oral depiction is more suited for an older audience. Or an audience that’s reached a certain age of maturity to understand and relate to the story. The griots in the comic book are very loyal to the king, but the griots in the oral history use guile to exploit the king. These might reflect the vision that these two sources have. For the griots in the comic book, those loyal to the king, helping them out, maybe stimuli to the readers for an image of society as being friendly, benevolent, on your side. Enemies do appear. But in the SUnjata oral history, the griots might signify that society is full of people who might backstab you at any time. Serve as a warning of some sort. This more gritty, down-to-earth portrayal in the oral history is a major difference.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">The two versions of Sunjata epic differ in many aspects, and whether the Buffalo woman episode is included is especially noticeable. What intention might there be for lacking this specific episode? If this was not an intended deletion, then how does this difference affect readers' response? (Sua)</p><p dir="ltr">Is it intentional that the Buffalo Woman is left out in the Sunjata Text? (Jana)</p><p dir="ltr">In Bambo Suso's "Sunjata," the overall plot focused more on the comparison between how fit he is to serve between his brothers. In the comic, he is glorified more than compared to his counterparts. Is this because the two wanted to portray a different character? Could it be because they are of different natures of the source? (Jacqueline)</p><p dir="ltr">In the Bamba Suso, "Sunjata" text, Sunjata is described as angered by the injustice done to him in line of succession as he actually is the newborn, and refuses to walk for 7 years up until he has to try on the trousers that will decide the next king. In the comic version however, he is always calm and collected, and is kind to the people who plotted against him and has mercy for them, and ultimately talks and walks for the first time to comfort his mother when he sees her saddened about her late husband. In both versions, what effect does Sunjata's depiction by the author have on the audience? (Simena)</p><p dir="ltr">In the comic, Sunjata's story ends with Sunjata leaving with her mother as his mother thought that it was dangerous for Sunjata to stay. However, the ending in the novel version is different as there is no mention of Sunjata leaving. What did the authors want to portray in the ending, and how did these differences in the same story occur? (Manseok)</p><p dir="ltr">--On women and implications for societies today</p><p dir="ltr">In the Sunjata texts, women were regarded as inferior to men on a few occasions; including The Mansa’s refusal to share his father’s inheritance with his sisters, and how Sunjata’s mother was constantly referred to as “the ugly woman”.

(Kevin)</p><p dir="ltr">In the Sunjata - Warrior King of Mali story, we can feel the importance that the Griot assigned to Sunjata had, and how this brought an even bigger hatred from his brothers.

                    The Power of a Prophesy or Stories<br><br>
                    The first illustration we see in Sunjata - Warrior King of Mali graphic novel is of this man standing brave with an army around him while holding a staff with a buffalo’s skull. This man was Sunjata, who by an old prophecy was supposed to become a great king. The staff represented his mother, who we know became a buffalo after the discrimination and injustices of her brother. All this caused our protagonist and his mother to be discriminated against during all their lives in the tribe. But after reading some pages and coming back to the cover, we can deduct that Sunjata would become all that he was promised by an old prophecy.<br><br>
                     Although we see that he didn’t have an easy life, he overcomes everything in silence, while his Griot narrates and sings stories about his ancestors and his future. It would seem that these tribes would respect prophesy and believed important to keep the memories of the lives that came before. As mentioned in the novel, it was “with the power of his ancestors ” that he founded strength to start walking and talking against all odds. <br><br>
                    The graphic novel does not show what happened at the end of Sunjata story, but we saw in its last pages how there was a new starting point for the people in the tribe. It is impressive how someone that had been discriminated against all his life and criticized by others can grow into such a beloved character with that big sense of compassion, justice, and equality. They saw how the prophecy was becoming true, and this man that used to be a liability started taking care of those in need without asking for anything in return. It is possible that Sunjata’s character was influence by the prophecy, but he could have easily become a tyrant king who would fight his brother for the throne and favor the man. Instead, he was forged by all those who came before, and her mother.<br><br>

                  <p dir="ltr">Manseok: I’m the leader for our discussion today and I thought we would start with interpreting primary sources. Can Lee Keeyoung read her question?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: It’s actually Kyeyoung, but cool typo, should be my nickname.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interpreting primary sources</p><p dir="ltr">Can the intended audience be thought as the same for all three documents? If so, what does that signify? (Lee Keyoung)</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Anybody who would like to answer this question, please raise your hand. Jacqueline?</p><p dir="ltr">Jacqueline: No it’s OK, it’s Jacqueline, or Jackie. But to answer Kyeyoung’s question, I don’t think so. I believe the travel diary was intended to be read by a scholar, for the book of routes and realms, the second text, I think that text was written as a story, maybe written for the general public, to give a general educational insight to people interested in learning about Ghana and its customs. For the first one, it could be used for the general public, but, then again, I think it could also be read any scholars that are willing to be educated more about trade routes and maritime trade in Africa.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Thank you Jacqueline, next we have Jana.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Jana: I think that the first text that we read of the tree, it could be for other merchants or sailors, not for the general public, because it had detailed instructions for how to reach the destination. It was like… I actually forgot the word, but it had some pretty detailed information about the trading goods. I don’t think the first text was for a general audience, but maybe the other texts. More general content. Could have been read by anyone.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Thank you Jana, next we have Sehwee Lee.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: I agree about the first and second text, but I think the third text was written because the Sultan of Morocco wanted it to be written. So for a Moroccan audience.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Kevin?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Kevin: I’m not certain that any of these texts were directed for a general public, because I don’t know about literacy at this time. Could the general population read? If literacy rates were low, then this is just for upper class, scholars or academics, not average people.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Rahaa Jeagar?</p><p dir="ltr">Asdf: I agree with Kevin that probably just a small fraction of society could have read these books, but in my opinion, the first primary source was written for traders and people who wanted to know what types of goods were in each place, when was the best time to set sail. The second one by Al Bakri is written for Moslem scholars. It has a scholarly script to it. And Ibn Battuta, is an adventurist, his audience can be more general among the literate people, maybe traders, scholars, princes, or members of royal families. Each of those people, couldn’t travel as easily as today, could have been interested and vicariously travel to all of these places. Of these three texts, Ibn Battuta's Travels has more elements of storytelling, more for a general audience.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Thank you Jeagar. We’ll move on to the next question. Jacqueline can read that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Jacqueline: This was my question</p><p dir="ltr">Do the texts' style and contents contribute to the current stereotypes and image of Africa? (Inouye, Jacqueline Wong)</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Anusha?</p><p dir="ltr">Asdf: For the last text, we can see the [missed some] derogatory terms… [missed] calls another AFrican “careless and mannerless,” something along those lines. Quite a few harmful stereotypes are being perpetuated.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Thank you Anusha, are there any other people wishing to speak for this question. If not, we’ll move on to the next question by Jana. Can you read your question?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Jana: One moment… I have to find it.</p><p dir="ltr">Do the different backgrounds of the authors have an impact on the story and how it is perceived? If so, to what extent does this influence perception? (Buenger, Jana Leonie)</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Thank you Jana, if anybody wants to speak, please raise your hand.</p><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Pertaining to the Periplus, the writer was a merchant. That’s why I suppose he got to travel to all of these places and tell the story of all of these foreign lands. Because he, or they, are a merchant, I noticed a lot of descriptions related to products, what people were using, buying and selling. I could tell that it was written from a merchant’s perspective.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Thank you Kevin, next Annet?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Grace: I believe that the experiences and insights of the writer influence the text. In the Travels, we can see that he was traveling from around 29 years, attacked by bandits, he was sharing his experiences and point of view. Can change how the reader will see this journey through all of these cities and civilizations.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Thank you, Simena?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Simena: For the last two, since both of the authors are Muslim, there was definitely a focus on Islam and how it was perceived by them, because it was their religion. There was more of a positive connotation, with Islam as a “savior religion,” I got that impression in the second document.</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Grace?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Grace: [very hard to hear... ]</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Let’s move on to Sua</p><p dir="ltr">Sua: This isn’t background, but the way they got their information is an important background. The first and third source directly met the culture with their own eyes, but the author of the second source didn’t directly travel to Africa himself. He heard from other merchants that had been to the continent, might have made the author more objective?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Thank you Sua, if we don’t have any more people, we can move to the next question by Anusha. Can you read your question?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Anusha: My question is the following and I was wondering about this because he never traveled to Africa.</p><p dir="ltr">What does the style of the al-Bakri text tell us about where al-Bakri sourced his information from? (Shanishetti, Anusha)</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Jusang?</p><p dir="ltr">Jusang: Sourced from travelers, traders, and maybe even storytellers, who were placed close to the elite in those African societies (like Ghana). And fromt he stories themselves, how the King respected the neighboring king’s religion. You would have to have access to these important people in order to know these stories. These rulers could explain them in a visual way. He could have heard this from someone else, but important traders would have greatly influenced the style of Al Bakri’s text.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Min Soo Kim?</p><p dir="ltr">Min Soo: So, I agree with Jusang that his information came from a variety of people, but what I wanted to point out is that in comparison--because Jusang said, it’s compiled from different people--it has a kind of “textbook like” quality, unlike the Ibn Battuta text. In the third text, a lot of the information has the context, we went to this place, met these people, had these encounters, but the Al Bakri text is organized much more like a textbook. I think that quality of the text shows that it was not based on his own direct experience.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Thank you, Min Soo Kim. Next, Rhaa Jeagar?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: I have a question… can I ask it?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Yes&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Asdf: A lot of you said that the king’s letter to the other king showed respect towards his religion, but I thought it was ironical and that he might have been mocking him, maybe even emasculating him. I was wondering if you thought that it was intended literarily or if there was irony.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Thank you, any comments about that?</p><p dir="ltr">Grace: OK, I’m so sorry… I thought that the author also seemed to look down a little bit on the king, he compared his dress to what a woman would wear. NOt bad, in and of itself, but because the author’s background and the time that he was writing in, I don’t think that it was meant in a positive way. The author didn’t have the best opinion of the king for wearing those clothes, and such.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Thank you Grace, Kevin?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Kevin: I definitely got a condescending attitude from that letter. No restraint. Giving an herb to an impotent man, it’s like giving somebody shampoo. It means you should wash more.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Thank you, Anusha?</p><p dir="ltr">Anusha: The king is trying to emasculate him by implying that he’s unable to bear children, saying that his clothes are feminine. It’s considered very offensive at that time, but in a very subtle way, but quite clever honestly.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Thank you, we can now move on to the next question.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Ali: I think that my question is similar but here is is…</p><p dir="ltr">Ibn Battuta was a well-travelled individual, visiting many countries across Africa on his Rihla; whereas al-Bakri was simply a person that documented the travels of other explorers. Does this affect the reliability of al-Bakri's texts? And if so, how significant is this effect? (Hamada, Ali Ayman Ali Fouad Ahmed)</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Thank you Ali, does anybody want to speak? Kyeyoung?</p><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: The part that I want to speak about is Ibn Battuta’s text is very detailed, particularly his experiences interacting with other people. He says things like “why are you not giving me gifts.” Which doesn’t happen in Al Bakri’s text. There’s a sense of his own biases coming out. Ibn Battuta’s own biases come out, when he talks about good traits and bad traits. [Al Bakri?] downplays those good and bad traits. Maybe Al Bakri is, if not more reliable, than less biased than Ibn Battuta.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Next Jessica?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Jessica: I’m not sure if we can talk about what’s more reliable, the first has ecological and environmental conditions of the trade, but the second one has a micro perspective. How the king was decorated, how people were believing in Islam, it differs in perspective, rather than judging reliability.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Thank you Jessica, any more speakers? Questions about the portrayal of Africans. A question from Jusang...</p><p dir="ltr">Jusang: Here’s my question...</p><p dir="ltr">-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Portrayal of Africans</p><p dir="ltr">How is each author similar or different in their opinions on the African people whom they have encountered, including religion, customs, etc? Does each author's description carry any positive or negative connotations? (Eum Jusang)</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: I thought that the third text had a negative connotation and the second more insights on the riches, the more developed parts of African societies, the relationship between royalty and subjects. I thought there was a strong contrast there.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Next, Ali?</p><p dir="ltr">Ali: I was thinking that it was important to not that, yes, the authors were belittling AFrican people, in Ibn Battuta’s text especially, but I’m not sure if that’s limited to their Islamic perspective, or people in Europe, or just that general idea of an inferior perspective on Africa/ It seems like other religions were respected. Even though they’re pro-Islamic, they didn’t criticize them, but talked about how these different religions coexisted.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Eugene?</p><p dir="ltr">Eugene: I think the third text, Ibn Battuta, makes more judgments about personal character. One king being described as “misery” or another not having a sense of shame. But the Al Bakri text, has biases, pro-Islam, but not many judgements about the character of the person, maybe because it was second-hand information.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Thank you Eugen, next, Jaeger?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: There was definitely so much bias, but I would say it bluntly, so much “mystical nonsense,” especially by Al Bakri. In my opinion, the focus of historians, these nations who have these resources to explore, they’re already rich and affluent with a different religion. They have this looking down attitude on these other nations. There was a lot of interesting information on the periphery of those places, especially in the second document. Attributing the rainfall to converting to Islam and praying, mystical nonsense, but if he said, “if you do this, and it rains, it will be the envy of other kingdoms.” What is the relationship of that kingdom with the kingdoms that surround it? It must be adversarial and if so, what is the source of that enmity? These travelers are imposing their ideas. But I think historians would look for that information on the periphery, not necessarily where the author is looking directly.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Thank you, Eugene?</p><p dir="ltr">Eugene: I might disagree with some of what Rahaa just said. I wouldn’t presume that these outsiders were richer and more advanced, if they came all the way down to this “less developed region,” they were seeking gains and advantages. It mentioned something about gold. Gold is less valued than salt, and the tone of that suggests that this is a weird thing. In most places gold is more expensive, here it’s the opposite. I wouldn’t think that in terms of development or wealth… I’m not sure that’s the case.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Nabi?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Nabi: From my point of view, the text has an overall positive view towards African people, but there are parts where he shows disrespect or negative opinions towards locals. But generally, he wanted to show that African people could be represented in a positive way, that their culture is developed. He gives a lot of information about trading and exchange of goods, can represent the strong side of African people in terms of the economy.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Thank you Nabi. I don’t think there’s time for a final question.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Zo: Al Baki’s story is based on other people’s travel stories, in my opinion, we can’t really rely on the authenticity, because we don’t know the motives of the people who presented those stories, we don’t know who they were, it’s different how a person will talk about a culture or people or country that he favors or dislikes. We don’t know how he filtered all that information. We have to take that into account. But if it were written by one person, we could trace it back.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Denton: Later, I’ll post some thoughts in the Kakao chat about “truly objective and reliable” sources as well as the notion of “bias,” something that was a theme of the discussion today. Also a couple of quick comments on the questions that didn’t get answered...</p><p dir="ltr">How would the throne succession in the Al-Bakri text influenced and changed the kingdom of Farwiyyun's society? Can we compare it with that of Sunjata? (Blano Ramirez, Annet)</p><p dir="ltr">I like this question about succession and that’s something that I’d like you to all pay attention to for both European and African societies.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Based on the texts we read, what type of information about a society do you think is the most difficult for an outsider to find out? (Kim Min Soo)</p><p dir="ltr">This is a question that we can keep coming back to and one that will work for many of the documents we read in this class.</p><p dir="ltr">What is the significance of trade in these records? What status did the traders have, officially and unofficially? (Cho, Sua)</p><p dir="ltr">I like that we finally touched on this issue towards the end of the discussion, particularly about the relationship between salt and gold. For all of you econ majors, you need to start asking questions like economic historians. What is the supply and demand story here? What about scarcity and abundance? Why is the fact that gold is less valuable than salt so important for people like Ibn Battuta? In these documents, always pay attention to clues about the larger economic structures that are undergirding these societies and the encounters between them.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Religion</p><p dir="ltr">How does the portrayal of Islam vary between parts of the texts, specifically in the Al-Bakri text between Ghana and Farwiyyun; and how does this impact the readers' view on the religion? (Kaplan, Simena Guelle)</p><p dir="ltr">In the second writing, there are multiple religions in one kingdom. Can this mean that one's own religious belief was more important than following the king's religion? (Manseok Han)</p><p dir="ltr">In Al-Bakri text, why was it so difficult for the King to convert to Islam while there were many Muslim inhabitants and Muslim officials? (CHU Myunghyun)</p><p dir="ltr">Do you think Islam religion influenced on the development of trade in those countries described in texts? Why? (Gali, Nabi)</p><br><p dir="ltr">For all of these questions about religion, this is a very important theme, and one that we’ll be coming back to again and again. Though it’s easy to dismiss a lot of this as “mystical nonsense,” I’d like you to remember that it was very serious for the people living at the time, because--as I talked about in the first week of class--they’re all living in an “enchanted world,” a world in which spiritual beings were thought to have actual agency and power in human affairs.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Finally, one quick comment on the idea of reliability of historical sources… one of the things that I hope you will come to appreciate in this course is that no source is ever "truly objective and reliable." All sources reflect, to a greater or lesser degree, the perspective of the individual who created the source. And all sources—because they're created by human beings—are not completely reliable. Once you accept that, you'll see that the task of the historian is quite difficult indeed. The task is not to find "objective and reliable" information, it's to sift through information that is inherently subjective and unreliable, compare those sources, and come up with the most plausible narrative. That's essentially what I'm asking all of you to do in this class!&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">And a quick common on "bias"…</p><br><p dir="ltr">I really don't like the word "biased" when used in a history paper, because it assumes that there is something that is "unbiased." The term also has negative connotations. "Biased" is something that most people agree is a bad thing, "unbiased" seems like a good thing. Try to substitute the more neutral, "subjective" and "objective" for "biased" and "unbiased" and see if it changes your meaning. You might find that you are using these terms because they imply a value judgement and if you remove that judgement, they don't really say much.&nbsp;</p><br><br>

                  Title: How could the king in Ghana Empire maintain its power?<br><br><br><br>
                  
                    There are less known about the origin of the Ghana Empire(300-1200CE) because of its lack of sources. Fortunately, by looking through the primary source written by a Muslim scholar Al-Bakri, we can notice that the royal authority played a critical role in maintaining its empire. However, there leaves some questions, especially regarding the relationship between religion and kingship. <br><br>
                    There was the king’s independent town. “The king has a palace and a number of domed dwellings like a city wall” and many “gold-embroidered materials”.  The reason why the king could maintain his enormous power was through trades with Arabs. Through “Muslim networks of maritime trade in the Indian Ocean” , Ghana Empire could sell huge amount of gold due to its blessed resources. Also, by importing weapons like arrows or horses, the king could set up his own army. 
                    This trade impacted the empire’s religious culture a lot. Arab traders attracted Africans to convert to Islam. In Roman times, North Africa was the century of Christianity. However, Islam became the main power by converts, Arab migrants, or intermarriages. According to the African history journal written by Jansen, “attraction of converts blurred the Muslim distinction between the realms of belief and unbelief” which is called paganism. <br><br>
                    However, what is surprising is that in Al-Bakri’s source, there describes the long journey of the king to be finally converted into Islam. Reflecting from historical background, it seems natural for the king to convert. Rather, the king of the Farwiyyun kingdom was sarcastic to the neighboring Muslim king of its Muslim marriage culture. The question left by this irony is that how the king in Ghana Empire can maintain its power by going against its thousands of Muslims. On one hand, this explains the reason why Ghana Empire was religiously tolerant. Still, further demonstrations are needed for this question. <br><br>

Minsoo, could you read your question first</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Minsoo: Reading the question…</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Based on the texts, do you think a common belief in Christianity contributed to peaceful coexistence among Europeans and Africans? (Minsoo)</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Jessica: Jusang?</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Jusang: In terms of peaceful coexistence, not necessarily. As you can see in the texts, in terms of Ethiopia, a predominantly Christian nation and Christian king, accounts of enjoyment to Europeans. Maybe in that case, but as you can see in one of the pictures in the Day 7 file, you have this native African man in armor, it also suggests that some Africans fought in Europe possibly against Europeans, the sculpture says “against the Slavs.” It also means that in terms of just Africans and Europeans. Christian Africans may have waged battles against non-Christian Europeans.&nbsp;</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Jessica: Thank you, next Ali?</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Ali: I wanted to say that it’s difficult to classify this as “peaceful coexistence,” one of the images was still an African trade, the slave trade was still a thing. Their common religious beliefs did not stop them from doing these things. But it did lead to some common understandings. Even in the Islamic conquest documents, we saw how religion played an important role in coexistence between African and European rulers being on good terms. But it is difficult to call it total peaceful co-existence.</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Jessica: Anybody else on this first question? If not, I’ll move on to the next question. Jana, could you read your question?&nbsp;</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Jana: Reading the question...</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Based on the texts you read, how does the image portrayed in the texts differ from last week's authors' perspective?

Eugene?</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Eugene: I can’t think of a difference, but I can think of a similarity. In the Herodotus text, it talks about the “people who were tall.” And in another text, there was a description of somebody who was 8 feet tall. Gold and ivory were recurring themes in the texts this week and last week.&nbsp;</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Jessica: Next, we have Sua.&nbsp;</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Sua: It took some time, because I couldn’t remember the texts last week. The key difference was that until last week we saw the African continent from the European perspective. It wasn’t the perspective of the discoverers, either they’re coming into the European continent through the slave trade or some other activities, we can see them included in the European community. In that terms, the perspective differs.</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Jessica: Kevin?&nbsp;</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Kevin: The key difference between this week and last week, this week is written from a Christian European perspective, but last week one was a Muslim scholar another by an Egyptian person. Last week was a lot about how people in Africa lived, what they bought, how they rode camels, things like that, and this week it’s more focused on the external appearances of Africans. Maybe they’re unfamiliar with African people, describe them as wild, fantastical people, heads below their shoulders, things like that.&nbsp;</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Jessica: Thank you, we’ll move on to the questions about the maps. Anusha, can you read your question?&nbsp;</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Anusha: Reading the question…</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">What types of people were maps back then made for? Did maps have more of an edifying goal or a goal of illuminating people on societal relations? (Anusha)</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Annet: One of the maps was commissioned by the King of France, more for historians, for the people in the court next to the king, in order to know better what was happening and how people in other continents were living. The main cities, the structures, the things like that. It was more for the royalty than the common people.</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Jessica: Simena?</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Simena: Just guessing, I would assume that they were for people in the upper side of society. Most people didn’t know how to read. I don’t know about the goal of illuminating people, whether it speaks to the social attributes of societies, but maybe a mix of both.</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Jessica: Sehwee?</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Sehwee: I think that normal people who move around a lot would need some kind of map, especially merchants, information and where to go. Commoners must have had some access to maps.&nbsp;</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Kevin: Looking at the map, maybe it had some kind of value as entertainment. It’s colorful; it has a lot of illustrations, drawings and pictures. It must have been pretty to look at. Not for navigation purposes, because it wouldn’t be that helpful, there are no roads, no lakes or rivers, there’s more descriptions of things rather than actual landmarks or keys that would help you navigate. Not even sure where north is here. Not really for navigating purposes.</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Jessica: Manseok?&nbsp;</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Manseok: I think that they were made to illuminate people, not just geographical features, but also buildings, how people in different areas dressed or the mode of transport they used. Addressed to historians maybe.&nbsp;</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Jessica: Nabi?</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Nabi: I totally agree with the opinions that it was made for historians, based on this map, made in order to [missed that part], also, there are important signs of important people who ruled particular regions in Africa. We can make some predictions or assumptions about the religion of each part of Africa. Made for people to be familiar with culture and religion of societies of peoples that lived during that time.&nbsp;</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Jessica: Kevin and Sehwee? No, I’ll turn this over to Jacqueline, the other discussion leader.&nbsp;</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Jacqueline: There are several questions about the individual sources. Annet, could you read your question for us please?</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Annet: Reading the question…</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">In the text "The history of High Ethiopia or Abassia" they mention how Presbyter was greater in power than any other King in the world right after the author mentions the materials of the two crosses he acquired after going to war. Did the author measure Presbyter's power by his devotion to Religion? Was the number of crosses a king carried significant in other parts of Europe at the time?

Based on my history, it was a defense against Mongol invaders. I think it’s kind of similar to what’s happening with the Prester John thing. They’re leveraging religion as a strength. I think it was a strategy in ancient times, I guess. But the difference there was that in the Prester John thing, it was a display of strength, instead of the creation of internal strength as in Korea. But using religion in times of war is quite</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Jacqueline: Kevin?</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Kevin: I don’t think how devoted you are relates to your power as a king. But the text said that he’s greater in power and glory because the crosses were made of precious stones. It was more valuable and was therefore a sign of status and power. The crosses prove that he’s a presbyter, a leader in the religion. That’s how I understood the text.&nbsp;</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Jacqueline: Anusha?</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Anusha: I agree, even in the previous text, the royalty always seems to have more gold, the common people get the dust, makes sense that he would hold a lot of power.</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Jacqueline: Let’s move to the next question, Simena?</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Simena: Reading the question…</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">In the "High History of Ethiopia" text, it is said that the mistake of Pero de Covilhao causes the name "Prester John" of the Asiatic emperor to be attributed to the Ethiopian emperor.

I’ve heard from somewhere that imperial Europe sent so many expeditions to Africa because they were searching for Prester John, the misconception that he was there, had this effect of fueling these European powers to intervene in African affairs. Misconceptions can have strong effects. The earlier explorers also mistook the Americas as India, giving birth to concepts and descriptions that still affect us today. Some people still use the term Indian to describe indigenous North Americans. Yeah, I agree that these misconceptions can result in very huge changes in society and culture.&nbsp;</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Jacqueline: Thank you, an interesting take, if there are no other comments, we could move to Jusang’s question.</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Jusang: Reading the question…</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Would Pliny's description of the strange men living in Ethiopia have directly influenced Shakespeare's inclusion of beings such as the "Anthropophagi" in Othello?

I think it’s true that there’s an influence on the imagination of people with mystical beings. Pliny wrote in the Roman times, and Shakespeare was writing in the 16th century, I think that some sort of other occurrence might have happened. When we look at the pictures, we have the black trumpeter, I’m not definite on this, but it turns out that it was from the Tudor period, pretty similar to when Shakespeare lived. The people that Shakespeare described are from a better understanding of black people than Pliny would have had.&nbsp;</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Jacqueline: Yes, thank you, we appreciate tangents.&nbsp;</b></p><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-e49f9bbb-7fff-08ce-827e-5ca7f0fa4ebe">Kevin: Difficult to pin down influences. Hard to show causation. I assume that Shakespeare chose to depict these people in an unflattering manner because most people were not familiar with Africa, couldn’t prove how correct his depictions were. It’s as if he almost tried to make those tales remotely believable. When did the perceptions of Africans become so savage and unrealistic as the ones that we see in Pliny and Shakespeare? In the paintings, Adoration of the Magi, a Biblical figure as an African person. Maybe the perception of African people wasn’t so horrible.

                  Different attitudes of  European imperial countries toward African people <br><br><br><br>
                  
                    Did African and European people have a peaceful relationship with each other? As Africa was a  colony of European imperial countries, it might be thought that there were no mutual connections. However, both peace and conflict relationships were present depending on the region of imperial European countries."<br><br>
                  Roman empire and Christian people had contradictions in terms of religion, while the west part of Europe kept positive connections with each other. Analyzing, “Saint Maurice Patron Saint against the Slavs” by anonymous sculpture, Saint Maurice is given as a black race person.  As Christianity meant a threat to the Roman Empire, the ruler was against Maurice who followed this religion. This was probably the way the author wanted to represent Roman Empire’s attitude toward Christians by giving him as Black raced. However, the western region of Europe positively viewed Ethiopian people as showing respect because they followed the same religion. In an illustration called “De Bellifortis”, an African woman is wearing very valuable objects made of gold in which European symbols are present.  This shows how Christian African people are respected in the West region of Europe as the author of this work was from that area (west part). In addition, the presence of African characters in  Shakespeare’s play Othello can also support the fact that even Africans were assimilated into the society so Christianity was probably the main reason for non-conflictual interaction between Africans and Europeans.

                  <p><b></b></p><p dir="ltr">Sewhee &amp; Nabi</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Let’s start, first question is from Kyeyoung, could you read the question for us?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Reading the question… “How were African rulers perceived in Europe? Would they be seen as equal, or at least more substantial then what we might have led to believe? (Kyeyoung)”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Any comments on that? Jusang?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: For me, it does depend on time as well as religion. For example, when traders from Europe were just starting out their trading posts in Africa, they would have viewed African monarchs as more, or less. Even if not equals, they would view them as trading partners. As colonization took hold, might see them as vassals, in a feudal sense, like tributaries. As time progresses, those ideas came into being. In terms of religion, in previous sources from previous weeks, with the Christian Ethiopian king, the sources stated how Europeans were impressed or how they came to give the ancient Christian faith. In those regards, they viewed them as more or less brothers, under one religion. However, as you can see, for the description of other religions, they’re less equals, and more condescending. More usage of derogatory terms. Time and religion are really big factors in deciding how African monarchs would be seen in Europe.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Kevin?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Building on what Jusang said, I felt like the European people viewed the African rulers as a means to an end, almost like something that would help them, through trade or conversion to Christianity to spread the religion, or make them gain greater access to power in Africa. From the first text, I got that kind of impression.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Thank you, anyone more that wants to comment? Yes, Anusha?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Anusha: They did not see them as equals, as we can see in the final text, sorry, nevermind, the one where they exchange letters between the Portuguese kings and the Kongo king, even he, Affonso, almost internalizes the inequality. He would refer to the Portuguese king as “your highness, I’ll kiss your hand,” but the Portuguese simply reply, “No, we’re not depopulating.” They really did not see them as equal from that one instance.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: So, building on what everyone said. For Europeans, especially ideologically, to allow themselves to go into these countries and see them as “negroes” and to enslave them, they needed to internalize the ideology of white supremacy. To clear their conscience, they had to view them as not equals.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Thank you for the comment, does anybody want to add? If not, we can move to the second question. Ali, could you read your question.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: Reading the question… “Why was it common for African rulers of the past to prioritize material gain over the prosperity and well-being of their states and their citizens? And why did a shift away from this method of ruling occur? (Of course, many countries' rulers still value financial gain over prosperity, but it is not socially acceptable anymore) (Ali)</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Any comments on that, yeah, Rahaa?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: I would say that the reasons why a ruler might be interested in caring for the building of these nations, instead of financial gain, might be the concept of “nationalism,” or the “shared imagined order,” the book from Yuval Harari, a brief history of the whole human kind. In it, he talks about all of these imagined orders, “culture, history, shared backgrounds,” which rallies us around hte flag of a nation. I think that concept is kind of weak in Africa, even today. Not a strong sense of nationalism, a very different culture and a concept of European nationalism is foreign to them.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Anusha?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Anusha: Multiple reasons behind this. It’s entirely possible that these rulers have tried to prioritize their people and have tried to hinder Europeans from hindering and taking their people. But once they realize it and find that it’s not a viable option. It’s an over-simplification. Additionally, I think there are things they can gain from Europeans coming to the countries. The Affonso text, they could have had advanced medical help. There were other ways they could progress by having Europeans in their country.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Kyeyoung?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung; It’s an interesting question and is similar to something I wrote about in my response paper. One of the main reasons might be related to the authors’ themselves. The context of these questions, the documents are mostly by the slave traders, if they were slave traders, they would have had the incentive to paint these kings as greedy, wanting to have these materialistic things, they wanted to lessen the inhumanity of the slave trade. Painting them as “barbarians” and wanting these materialistic goods, may have been a way to say “this is not only our fault, they wanted these things.” That’s one comment that I wanted to make.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Simena?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: Reading the documents, I got the impression that not all the leaders were doing this knowingly. Detached from their people. European technology was way ahead in terms of the age of discovery. Pushed African leaders to prioritize material gain.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Anybody want to add more? If not, Simena, you could read your question.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: Reading the question… “Why would the Portuguese king have welcomed a banished Guinean prince, Bemoym, as his honored guest; and if the King himself, aside from his military advisors, had any possible ulterior motives, why would he have been saddened by Bemoym's death? (Simena)”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Thank you, anybody want to comment on that? Rahaa?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: Pina del Roy was paid by the Portuguese king to write that, so he was very conservative in his approach, but he specifically wrote that it was a “truthful account” as truthful as it could be. He depicts all of those details, the lavish reception of Bemoym, in the end. He tried not to put the Portuguese in a bad light. The book doesn’t survive if he does that.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Interesting perspective, anybody else want to comment? Wait, before I move on. I would comment that the king wanted to invade the land of Bemoym because he wanted to build a fortress, there’s definitely a motive to invade the land. And was probably saddened because the opportunity to achieve that material gain was gone. Kevin, could you read your question?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Reading the question… “In the texts, religion was used as a political tool or a means to express oneself identity. To what extent did people believe in religion for the sole purpose of being faithful, and did not have a secondary, perhaps even ulterior, motive to practicing said religion? (Cha Hwan Seung)”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Thank you, anybody want to comment on that question? Please raise your hand.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: To me, the underlying idea and concept behind these texts are different interpretations of religion and why they follow them, or don’t. With Islam and Christianity, it’s different for different kings. Both are easily accepted by leaders in Africa. Still the most popular religions there. But also economic motivations, like trade, and expanding trading networks, but also Europeans trying to spread Chrsitniaty to oppose those Muslim traders who were dominating the market. Different reasons for following religions at that time.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Sua?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: Religion gives a reason to encourage or promote people for their own purposes. If they want to do something, they say, “it’s for God, it’s for this faithful purpose.” It could start as a solely faithful purpose, but then shift to secular purposes.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Thanks, Simena?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: In the text, it kind of talks about Christianity as a way of saving people. They’re using that cover as a way to take over the trade. I wanted to add that.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Thank you, if nobody wants to say more we can go to Anusha’s question.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Anusha: Reading the question… “With what purpose does Affonso I write in his letter to Joao III about the new law he passed that would indirectly exonerate and disregard all of the Portuguese's prior wrongdoings? (Anusha)”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Any comments on that? Is that your hand from earlier Simena? Going once, going twice…</p><br><p dir="ltr">Laken: I felt that he was doing this because he was so desperate to get the Portuguese to stop what they were doing. Forgiving them in the past, would give them an incentive to listen to his requests. But it clearly didn’t work out for him. More of an incentive… but it’s a last ditch effort from him.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Thank you, anybody who would like to comment? Rahaa?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: In my opinion, Affonso is Christian clergy, who sees the King as somebody who is bringing the true religion to him. He sees them as not just the force that is invading his country and enslaving his people. Affonso wrote to the king with this notion in mind. Like he’s a good Christian. After he received the reply, he must have been disillusioned. His faith must have suffered a real blow. That’s my opinion.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: The next question, Jusang?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: Reading his question… “Should Affonso I's appeals in his letters to the Portuguese kings be seen as a plea from a helpless vassal or an outright condemnation of Portuguese encroachment, and why? (Jusang)”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Yes, any comments on that? Simena?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: I thought it was a helpless plea because the African kings and royalty weren’t really keeping their stance and were treating those Portuguese kings as some divine power. Might have led it to be easier for those Portuguese kings to encroach on them.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Kevin, do you want to add?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: I agree that it was a helpless plea. It had that pleading tone. “Pray for our lord in his mercy … I kissed your hand many times.” I’m not sure if this is just a gesture of politeness, could be to flatter the kings or win them over with saccharin words. But there’s a power dynamic and you can see who’s in power in the way that Affonso speaks to the King.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Kyeyoung?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: I’ll play the devil’s advocate. I think there’s actually some power in the way that Affonso uses Christniaty, and compares these Christian ideas about persecution… Affonso is saying, or asking for these priests and doctors, it’s also adding truth to the value that he’s “not a barbarian.” It gives the idea that he’s a “civilized person” who knows and cares about his subjects. I think there’s some power in those arguments.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: I think we should skip the other questions about the Affonso text and I’ll give them a mic to Nabi.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: We’ll start with Annet’s question.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Annet: Reading her question… “What parameters were used to define the price of slaves while discussing it and who used to set them? Did they ever have a limit on how many slaves could a person have during that time? (Annet)”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Who would like to answer that question? Sua?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: Obviously the “quality” of the slaves, “physical” or “mental,” were one of the parameters. Gender could be another parameter. Male and female slaves were “used” for different purposes. Whether they had a family or not, wasn’t important, the families were separated. They didn’t really have a limit on how many slaves one person could have. And there wasn’t also the moral pressure against having slaves. People who fought for human rights, also had slaves at this time, which they used for their own purposes.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you, anything to add? Jacqueline?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jacqueline: I wanted to add to what Sua said about how slaves were analyzed for buyers to decide which ones they wanted to buy. In terms of slaves and families, I think the parameters are defined by specific slaves, men &amp; women, physical capabilities and also their age. When I would learn about slavery in American or US history, we learned about how men were obviously sold at a higher price, but women and young women were also sold at higher prices because of fertility. Wanted to add to that. Women giving birth to children is cheaper than buying more slaves.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you, who would like to add anything? We’ll move on to the next question. Sua, could you read your question?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: Reading her question,&nbsp; “Exactly for what purpose were the slaves used? Where did the slaves eventually land? Why were they so valuable and traded for goods of high value? (Sua)”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Any comment? Annet?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Annet: From what we’ve seen from other sources, they would be used for any hard work or manual labor that Europeans didn’t want to do, or if there were people who they saw as inferior to them. Housekeeping. Strong men in farms, building stuff. For the other part of the question, where did they land, they first go to the person that bought them, but that person could move or sell them.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you, Jusang?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: Building on what Annet said, if I were to answer the question for the purpose of the slave, as well as their value. It’s definitely hard labor. Plantations in the New World. A lot of them were transplanted there, cotton and palm plantations, and agricultural industries. That field is the trade between the empires of Europe. That also answers the question of where they would land. That’s why you can see a large distribution in the maps, previous sources, how a lot of them are transported to New World colonies. I heard from somewhere that Europeans used this excuse of tropical climates as a justification for purchasing slaves from Africa for the tropical New World climates.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you, Simena?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: Adding to what Aneet and Jusang said. They were valuable because machinery wasn’t invented. Human power was still the most valuable.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you, Kevin?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Regarding the value of the slaves, maybe a part of it has to do with travel and the fact that many people had to traverse oceans to get to their destination. Perhaps that’s not an easy task, transporting people across such great distances. Text was difficult to read because it was so horrible. Slaves committing suicide before reaching their destination. Arduous path. Maybe that made the slaves more scarce, and more expensive if they had to travel great distances.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Jana?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Male slaves used for fights and wars, could be because slaves had to be loyal to their master. Also for entertainment purposes, they organized fights. Not using their own people. Seen as inferior people.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you, Sua?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: It’s a little weird that I’m answering my own question, but I think that they were valuable because they were reproducible, treated as things. Even as the original buyer dies, the offspring could inherit the slaves, continuously use them.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you, Zo?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Zo: Besides all the labor stuff, I think a possible value was about the indication of the message of power, wealth and status. The more slaves a master had, the more the master may have had power and money. All the rich people competed with each other in how many slaves they had. We’ve seen in a lot of American movies, how these rich people have many slaves. One value.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you, so now we’ll move on to the question of Eugene. Eugene, could you read your question?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Reading her question… “How did the slave trade become such an easy thing? Didn't the Portuguese have any qualms about tempting people to enslave others in exchange for material goods and the Africans about willingly selling off their neighbors to acquire those goods? How does one explain this moral free-for-all (aside from moral explanations)? What led to such a state of social collapse? (Eugene)”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Any comments? Opinions?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: I kind of talked about this in my response paper and, like I said, religion was used as a means of salvation to save people. I think that gave Portuguese invaders the moral support that they could do such horrendous acts and also because some African kings were so accepting of this impression of religion, that they needed to be saved. Easier to go through with this.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you, Minsoo?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Minsoo: My point is similar to Simena’s, but not quite. Simena was talking about people’s mindset concerning Christainity, but another mindset that they might have had was that because the slave trade was so widespread, since everyone was doing it, I can kind of go along with the flow. That everyone was doing it might have been prevalent at the time. It helps to think about things that we’re doing in the present that in 100 or 200 years we may look back and thing, “how could these people have done such immoral things.” Factory farming, animal testing. We don’t know the answers right now, but maybe in a couple hundred years, this might be seen as completely immoral, similar to the way we think of the practices of the people in the past. They had a different mindset.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thanks, Jessica?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jessica: I think morality is not the absolute standard of our standards today, but defined in their time. Looking back from their perspective, they might have justified it between the different status between slaves and themselves. They might have not recognized the morality of the slave trade at that time. As Simena mentioned, Christian converts played a huge role in the moral support of that trade.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you, Grace?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Grace: Maybe repetitive based on what others have said, situation at that time was that slavery was OK, everybody’s doing it, not that shocking. Maybe I’m misunderstanding that what Jessica said, I think they would have thought that it was a “moral and right action,” in one of the readings, the author was talking about how the people who jumped off the ship were crazy because they were going to a place that was better than their own homes, saw them as “poor creatures,” we’re offering a better life. They don’t know how to live and survive on their own and we’ll help them with that.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Ali?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: Kevin, do you want to speak first?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: I’ll make it brief. Similar to what Grace brought up, they’re justifying their actions. There’s this line, “that the fate . . . are transported from the coast to America . . . less deplorable than . . . that they may live longer and do them more service.” They’re convincing themselves that they’re doing the right thing. Shocking to me.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you. Who would like to continue? Ali? Or Jusang?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: Jusang?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: Since the question also stated aside from moral explanations, I’ll go with the economic perspective. On the Portuguese side, a common element for European empires was mercantilism. Almost a parasitic relationship between metropole and colonies. Slaves are extra cogs in the machine to generate more income more efficiently. Mercantilism drove the Portuguese to continuously purchase more slaves to fuel the economic activity of their empire. From an African perspective, there is a very large wealth and power gap between African and European kingdoms. African powers looking for short-term economic gain, maybe they’re prioritizing the accumulation of more national wealth, perhaps selling slaves was an easier way to do so.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Ali?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: I’ll keep it really brief. Christianity as justification. But not the only reason. Can’t blame religion on a system that was already in place in Africa before the arrival of those religions. Richer AFrican things think that minor people don’t have a way to manage their own lives. There was already a pre-existing slavery, even if it was more minor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Does the documents by slave traders reinforce our previously held perceptions about slave trade, or does it change our perceptions?

                  “New World” and African Slaves as a Basis of European Imperialism<br><br><br><br>
                  “Map of the African Slave Trade, 1440-1867” and “A Description of the Coasts of North and South Guinea” written by John Barbot present two intertwined factors that contributed to the development of imperialism: the construction of African slave trade routes, and the ‘discovery’ of American continent. As an ideological basis of African slave trade, Barbot’s text contextually reveals religious beliefs as well.<br><br>
                  The trade routes in “Map of the African Slave Trade” illustrates the factors consisting 15th to 19th century slave trade. While the Europeans were the pioneers and protagonists of transatlantic slave trade, the actual use of African slaves, as tradable ‘goods’, mostly took place in American continent, some in other regions of Africa—noticeably very few in Europe. Barbot also mentions that “[t]he trade of slaves [was] in a more peculiar manner the business of kings, rich men, and prime merchants, exclusive of the inferior sort of Blacks.”  This record explicitly suggests that the slave trade was not merely for individual wealth or commercial profits, but rather for a macroscopic purpose involving the exploitation of American continent, possibly leading to the advent of imperialism in 19th century. Utilizing America as plantation farms, and Africa as a factory supplying free laborers to cultivate American farms, the Europeans were able to establish an international cycle that was schemed to expand their power, at the expense of exploiting other continents.<br><br>
                  The record by Barbot also unveils that a religious and cultural explanations existed as a justification. While criticizing slave trade as “barbarous,” the author mentions that the slaves’ fates are “less deplorable, than that of those who end their days in their native country,” also asserting for the “inestimable advantage … of becoming christians, and saving their souls.”  This strongly supports the religious justification of Europeans for their mercantilist attitude, believing that they are ‘helping’ the poor African’s salvation.<br><br>

                  <p><b></b></p><p dir="ltr">Europeans’ views on Africans</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: We’ll start with Jana’s question, so Jana, please read your question.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Me? Yeah, one moment. I’m sorry. “What could have led the Europeans to have such a low bid of Africans and put themselves on a high pedestal? Apart from the Africans who betrayed and sold their own countrymen, how did the Europeans decide to make slaves of these very people? Why not men of their own country or from other countries? (<a href="https://www.learnus.org/user/profile.php?id=468075">Buenger, Jana Leonie</a>)”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: Thank you, we’ll start with Anusha.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Anusha: I think this is a really good question. As far as I know, Europeans did enslave their own people. It was a process of indentured slaves, or whatnot, but after a certain point they needed more people. It wasn’t ethical to take them… worried about revolt. Especially considering the location, they were in a very convenient location. Worked out that way.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: Jacqueline?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jacqueline: I agree with Anusha, and going back to what she said. Europeans also decided to enslave African people, because unlike indentured servants, African slaves were sold. Easier to obtain by buying and bidding, then using indentured servitude. Like Anusha said, it was harder for Europeans to enslave other Europeans, fear of retaliation. These slaves couldn’t understand the same language and came from different areas, less motive to retaliate, lack of communication and a sense of community amongst themselves.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: Nabi?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Landholding in Africa influenced the way that Africans sold slaves to survive. Prevention of people from owning land led to the slave trade.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: Thank you, anything else to add? OK, we’ll move on to Hwan Seung’s question.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: My question, "Barbaric," or words similar to it, were terms used very frequently to describe African men and women in these texts. What about the word "barbaric" above other words did the Europeans find so apt to use when describing Africans? What popularized using the word in such a manner, and how did the word contribute to the stridently racist rhetoric prominent among Europeans? (Cha Hwan Seung)”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: Grace?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Grace: So this is just a theory, but the word “barbaric,” comes from the Latin word, “barbarus,” which the Romans would use to describe anybody who was foreign. Particularly people living in northern Europe. As the Romans explored more of Europe and later civilizations grew, “foreigners” came to mean “others,” like in Africa or India and other places like that. It started out as a word for “foreigners,” but as opinion changed it took on a more negative connotation.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: Jusang?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: A similar interpretation of the Greek use to refer to “non-Greeks,” the term really started gaining this negative connotation most probably because of the European renaissance, a revival of ancient Greek and ancient Roman cultures, they owe their modern development to that culture, arts, and architecture--and so that term was adopted&nbsp; outsider, less advanced. I think that’s why they might have applied it to the Africans. A similar term could be “pagan,” used by the Europeans against the Chinese, originally used to refer to religions outside of the Abrahamaic group. That might have had a big role in Europeans categorizing others as barbarians.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: Sua?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: I thought these terms were used because they’re so convenient for justifying exploitation. Europeans thought that they were the peak of civilization, saw themselves as the smartest, most “civilized,” when they encountered AFricans as being different from their lifestyle, could divide between “civilized” and “uncivilized.” That gets connected to the Enlightenment. Because they’re “uncivilized,” we can treat them as we want, with whatever means possible.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: Thank you Sua, Kevin?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: I asked this question because I agree with the viewpoint that the Renaissance contributed to it, the Europeans--seeing themselves as people of art, writing, and culture--thought that the Africans were unaccustomed to that. Thought that they were devoid of art, writing, and culture. Found it interesting that Sua mentioned the word savage. By definition, it’s derogatory, but in the modern era, kind of reclaimed as even a complement. That’s interesting too. My closing thoughts.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: Good interpretations of language use. It might actually connect to the next question. Nabi?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: “Why did views on African people vary in Europe? What examples can you give? (Gali, Nabi)”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: Eugene?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: I think a lot of the initial variation was a desire to sound as scientific as possible. But at this time, they didn’t know a lot of things or have the technology…. Maybe they weren’t as rigorous. But, over time, as others read what they were saying, there might have been a shared consensus.</p><br><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: Kevin?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: I felt that some texts had a tone that was more attacking than others, even though they all had discriminatory overtones. Some were more virulent, Kant’s was less offensive than some of the others, even though it’s still very wrong. That intensity of hate is something that we could discern amongst the texts.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: Sehwee?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Has to do with the sheer size of the continent. Pretty big, lots of different groups of people. Would be hard for Euroepans to have a unified view of Africans, too many people.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: Nabi?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: I noticed that in the text that we read this week, there were two types of descriptions given to the different groups of people. The first one sees black people as “uncivilized,” but the other as “civilized” at a surface level. At that time, it was not allowed to share objective ideas that were objective. That is why many people were limited and tried to interpret findings in the way the government instructed, I think that’s the main reason why black people weren’t explained in a scientific way. I also think that the French revolution influenced these descriptions. I noticed that, even though it was at a surface level, the description of African people started to change in a positive way.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: Anything to add? We’ll move on to the next question. It will be Annet now.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Annet: We’ll go to Grace’s question.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Grace: “In many of this week's readings, the authors gave reasons for why they thought dark skinned people were inferior to light skinned people. In your opinion, is this reasoning the cause of racist beliefs or an excuse for racist beliefs? That is, did the authors write to explain how they came to believe that they were superior or did they write because they wanted to justify how they felt? (Shubin, Grace Elizabeth)”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Annet: Rahaa?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: I think we are calling these people with terms that didn’t exist at that time. It wasn’t “racist,” it wasn’t their world view. If we deem this as wrong, it’s the culture and activism that has been happening in recent years that has raised their awareness and we know that it’s wrong. For these people, it’s how they perceive their reality. It’s not that they’re being racist, they are, in our view, but not to themselves or to their audience.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Annet: Very true, Anusha?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Anusha: Yeah, I think Rahaa brings up a really good point. Considering the fact that there are many reasons listed, it’s not exactly stated as a fact, it’s more of an argument being made. It’s a theory, but I think it’s possible that they’re trying to convince the people reading these texts that these are the reasons why “Africans are less than us.” It could be Europeans back home or fellow Africans, to bring them down, but to me, it plays out like an argument.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Annet: Kyeyoung?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: I wanted to talk about the French, Nabi touched on this when he talked about the French revolution. The French made the expectation that the slave trade should be abolished because of the ideals of the French Revolution. The document makes the argument that enslaved people have inherent rights. It shows that the Europeans could start to see the Africans as humans. That’s why there’s so much dialogue trying to differentiate them. They knew, at a certain level, that they were similar. It’s a way of justifying how they felt.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Annet: Nabi?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: During that time, it was common for each nation or country to have its [?], people who came from abroad were considered as totally different. Like we mentioned about Romans considering outsiders as barbaric. Europeans see Africans as uncivilized.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Annet: Manseok?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: More about how they felt. Reading David Hume’s “On National Characters” I felt like he was just adding random aspects to make a distinction between white and black. I think that he had already made his decision and conclusion and added these components to justify his pre-existing idea.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Annet: Kyeyoung?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: We don’t write about the difference between cats and dogs, they’re different, but when we start writing about differences, we’re actually acknowledging similarities. That’s another way of thinking about this.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Annet: Kevin?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: You can see that the bias shows [?] language, if you look at the Linneaus text, using flowery language to describe Europeans, but other races are described as “indolent, negligent.” You could say “accentuated” or “thick” lips instead of “humid,” lots of unsavory words. You could see how it’s not actually science. It’s very biased. Interesting how they pretend to be objective, but you can see how they’re not.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Annet: Zo’s question, Zo?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Zo: “The texts highly emphasized the studies on the cause of Africans' "blackness" of skin. What was the reason behind this research? Why were these studies on skin color important? Also, is it possible that the 1789's Declaration was named "... of the Rights of Man of the Citizen" intentionally so it would not include African slaves as they weren't citizens? (<a href="https://www.learnus.org/user/profile.php?id=468017">Oyunbaatar, Zolboo</a>)”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Annet: Rahaa?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: That’s actually a typo, “of the man and of the citizen,” it didn’t even include women. There was a letter by a female activist a year or two after the declaration. Only included French male citizens, not women, let alone AFricans.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Annet: Simena?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: I wouldn’t say that these studies on blackness was out of bad intentions, but because of not understanding it…. The importance of hte studies was that they added to the stigma in Europe that darker skin color was not as good as whiter skin color. Five years after this declaration slavery was abolished in France, I wanted to add that.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Annet: Min Soo?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Min Soo: I’m not sure why I could say these studies were important at the time, but in the course of history, for Europeans to discover people who looked different was obviously a shock, but once they start studying about skin color, it trickles down and influences science in general. It influenced the study of biology and genetics and the relationship to the environment. For example, it’s similar to how in a crisis situation we’ve done so much research on vaccines, like Professor Denton mentioned, it might be that because we’ve made so much progress that it is solving problems we’ve had already (like malaria). Like these skin color studies, it was a crisis for the Europeans, as they studied that, it added to science in general. Not concise, but that was my thought.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Annet: Very interesting, Sua?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: I want to answer both questions. First, for the importance of skin color study, it was a trend between these Enlightenment philosophers at this time. Four to five years, many famous philosophers published essays about this, what they think about racial superiority and inferiority. They wanted to give their own opinions about this issue, probably adding more scientific methods to examine this issue. I think it wasn’t intentionally excluding African slaves, but rather reflected the social norm, not intentionally, naturally. They were just writing the declaration only regarding those people that were considered citizens, human beings at that time.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Annet: Thank you for all of your comments!</p><br><br><p dir="ltr">The texts highly emphasized the studies on the cause of Africans' "blackness" of skin.

                    Good Deed or Strategic move?<br><br><br><br>
                    During the war between Spain and France at the end of the 1790s, the king of Spain decided that in order to win he would need to recruit more soldiers and increase his armed force. To do so, he could get others that were already rebelling against France to join him. Since he knew the situation between the slaves at St. Domonique and their colonists, the king offered freedom to all the slaves in this territory who would join his side. But was he trully willing to receive them in their society once the war was over? Was he doing this because he supported the slaves' cause or was it just a strategy to increase his army?<br><br>
                    Spain had many other colonies at the time, in which they also were exploiting slaves for their personal gain. The mainland did not care about the condition of the colonies as long as they shipped them enough to grow their wealth and global position. Citizens of these other colonies had no freedom of speech, right to vote, or even trade with other countries, some of the reasons why Domonique’s slaves were fighting for. Knowing this we can assume they did not believe blacks Africans were equal to white Europeans and were only offering them false hope because they wanted to weaken even more the Frenches. The king of Spain's plan was probably just to obtain control of the territory once the war was over and state it as another of his colonies without fulfilling his promise. With France gone and many of the slaves dead Spain would not find any resistance in this attempt to expand its territory. This was not a good deed from this king, but a strategy of war that would only benefit him and the citizens of his homeland.<br><br>

                  <p><b></b></p><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Hi, we’re having our discussion now. The first question I have is Kyeyoung’s question. CAn you read it out loud? Kyeyoung?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: I’m searching because my Wifi is slow… it might take some time. “What conclusion would the judge have made, and why? What sorts of underlying assumptions do the questioners &amp; the judge hold about slavery?”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Any takers? Simena?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: Judging from the text, I would think the judge would vote against Abina. Everybody undermined her and gave points that showed that her slavery couldn’t be proven. Since slavery was abolished by the British empire, it couldn’t exist, so they used that base to maybe justify slavery in an illegitimate way.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Anybody else to add on?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: Actually, I think I disagree. There’s the presiding judge. Then Hutton Brew, defending the defendant, then there’s Abina, then there’s Davis, the one who’s helping Abina in the court. The strategy that Hutton Brew is using, de jure, by law, there is no slavery, de facto, Abina is not a slave. Thus the Ordinance Law cannot be used to liberate her from the family. Abina parries those arguments by showing that de facto, in practice, was a slave. That’s my opinion.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Anybody else? Jusang?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: For me, the judge would have made a judgement in favor of Abina’s complaint, more because the underlying assumption is that she was being questioned as to whether she was aware of slavery being abolished and slavery as an institution. The judge might have thought that she was denied the knowledge of the law. Based on the year that it was written, Salt Pond was under British control and where she was previously was not under British control. The judge assumed that when she moved to British territory, she had no knowledge, and was excluded by the defendant. With those assumptions, I think the judge would be more compelled to be with Abina’s stance, rather than against.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Simena?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: In the comic, it says the judge based on four factors, 1) seeing a transaction of money 2) being called a slave, etc., showed that he would only admit if she had concrete proof. Implies that she doesn’t want to admit it.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Interesting, any other takers? If not, we’ll move on to the next question. By Annet…</p><br><p dir="ltr">Annet: My question was “Abina received a Handkerchief as a present from Tandoe. This is repeated twice during the passage. Did this handkerchief symbolize anything specific or was it a common gift at that time?”&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Anusha?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Anusha: I’m not sure about the symbolic meaning, but I believe that at the time, it was the master’s responsibility to take care of the clothing of the slaves they had at that time. African women were required to wear a scarf, or using a handkerchief, possibly why the master gave her that handkerchief, maybe extra cloth lying around?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Manseok?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Manseok: I think the handkerchief is to put their hair up, but that the master gave them, it symbolized ownership. He gave it to show that he owns Abina.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Kevin?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: If I recall correctly, the handkerchief is traditionally a symbol of marriage. You give the handkerchief to somebody you will marry to symbolize fidelity. I don’t think it’s an African tradition. I associate that with marriage, but I don’t think Abina got that interpretation.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: I’ll call on Grace first, since she hasn’t spoken.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Grace: In one part of the transcript, Melton asks Abina, “did he take away your cloth” and she says “no, only the beads.” Perhaps when she was owned by somebody else, she had a different cloth. The handkerchief symbolizes ownership.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Rahaa?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: What I read in the paper from Getz, was that to ask a woman for their hand in marriage, they had to give gifts of cloth and beads to ask her to marry. He’s giving the handkerchief, because he’s miserly, and didn't want to give her a proper cloth. In the text, Tandoe will “give her a lot of cloth,” but just a handkerchief, shows that he doesn’t respect her, or recognize her social position or status. A handkerchief can be symbolic of that “head price,” a social norm in that society.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: I think we can move on to the next question. Which is from Jusang.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: My question is “What could the defendant not giving Abina the proper knowledge of her lawful freedom tell us about the problems present in African societies after abolition?”&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Ali?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: This shows how this whole system of slvery was primarily driven by Africans themselves, of course not completely, but amplified by Europeans, some African states or empires relied on slavery for their economy. Perhaps this per-existing societal norms of richer and poorer, taking poorer people into slavery, upper class people felt that needed to stay.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Simena?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: I agree with what Ali said. Hutton said that he and his family benefitted from the war between the Asante and the British. A part of those upper class people want to keep slavery in place because it benefits them as well.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Sua?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: I agree, it obviously shows that abolition was not done by Africans, it was a means of Europeans to control the African society from their interests.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Thanks, are there any more takers? We’ll move on to the next question? The next question is from Jacqueline but there were other similar questions.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jacqueline: My question was “Based on the context of Abina's trial, do you think cases like hers were common during this time? What does this tell us about what slavery actually looks like in African societies?”&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: And the next question which was similar, was mine, “What was so special about Abina's case that it merited to be taken to court?” The other question that was similar was Jana’s.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: “What was the reason Abina was not told she was a free person and was only revealed in court? Was it to ridicule her, or could it be for another reason?”</p><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Any thoughts in relation to any one of those questions? Kyeyoung?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: I want to focus on marriage as a tool of slavery. For African societies, marriage could also be seen as slavery. But at the same time, it’s also so that marriage--being a tool of slavery--is because of hte European act. There was technically no slavery allowed, what her previous husband did and what the defendant was doing now, was to force her into her role by having her marriage. I think I also read this in the paper given to us, because to her husband, Abina was married, it was not a slave-owner relationship and he could get through the border. When he gave her to a household servant, they were bound together in a marriage relationship, which complicates the matter of slavery. It’s a loophole to get around abolition.</p><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Let’s hear from Zo, one of our moderators.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Zo: I don’t think cases like Abina’s were often taken to court. In the historical context, young girls made good slaves because they were less prone to running away or reporting their masters. Because the slavery was legally abolished, these girls were taken in as wives or apprentices, but technically they were just slaves. That’s it.</p><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Jessica?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Jessica: I heard from the article that after abolition, women were [missed that] but it seems that women could not practically abandon slavery entirely. It was showing people what slaves’ rights were.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Nabi?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Nabi: The case that we were assigned tells us that exploitation of slaves was a common issue in Europe. I think that these kinds of cases were common in Europe.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Do we have anybody else? If not, I’ll pass the floor to Zo.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Zo: Next we have a set of questions concerning slavery in general. We’ll start with Sua’s question. Can you read it out loud?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Sua: My question was “We can clearly see from the court transcript that the abolition of slavery was for show, not allowing the actual alleviation of slavery or improvement of African's living condition. What effect would have been caused by this seeming abolition? Did it reinforce Britain's imperialism? Did it deepen the conflicts within/between African communities? Also from today's perspective, how can we view this abolition? Immoral? Clever? Ineffective?”</p><p dir="ltr">Zo: Anybody want to answer the question? Simena?</p><p dir="ltr">Simena: I would definitely say that the actual abolition of slavery, not contributing to the acts of it, helped British imperialism, because--for example--in other countries, Turkey as well, imperialism and colonialism was renamed, slavery became forced labor. It alleviated the moral and public consequences that the public suffered in the world, couldn’t be held responsible, made it easier for them to conduct actions like slavery in an underground manner.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Zo: Anybody else? If not, we’ll move to the next question.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Jessica: “What would be the reason that beads which were considered precious, were attached to slave women's bodies? Is this related to the fact that Abina was a 'domestic slave'?” Oops, my question disappeared…</p><p dir="ltr">Eugene: I’m repasting them in order…</p><p dir="ltr">Jessica: Rereading the question.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Zo: Anybody want to answer that question? Simena?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Simena: Cutting the beads symbolized a girl transitioning to womanhood. If I recall correctly.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Zo: Anybody else? We’ll move on to the next question. Nabi, can you read yours?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Nabi: “Do you think indifference towards Africans was present in the court? How was it seen exactly?”</p><p dir="ltr">Zo: Any takers? Grace?</p><p dir="ltr">Grace: For me, the language recorded in the transcript many times came off as a little condescending, on the part of the important men. There’s one instance, where Brew says, “who put this notion into your head that you were a slave?” The way he framed it made me believe that he was not taking the case as seriously as we would expect the case to be taken. That shows some indifference.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Zo: Sua?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Sua: THe conditions of the court are unfavorable to Abina. She has to present herself as a slave, give evidence by herself showing that she was a slave. But the court itself is run in a European style, so it would have made it difficult for Abina to represent herself. Shows indifference towards her situation.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Zo: Sehwee?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: I think they were a bit hostile to Abina for various reasons. But I don’t think they were indifferent. They were trying to use the circumstances that were given in a political manner, rather than being indifferent.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Zo: Interesting, anybody else want to add something here? If not, I would read my own question, “According to the text, Yaw Awoah purchased Abina to be his wife, yet easily sold her to Eddoo and cut the beads off of her. Was marriage back then something you could easily purchase? If a man marries a woman, and the woman becomes a subject to the man through beads, could he just sell his wife and cut the beads, since he "owns" his wife?” Rahaa?</p><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: The beads are not valuable, per se, like gold, but they have a symbolic significance. In the case of Abina, it seems like there were so many matriarcal connections in that society. When a woman has a conflict with her husband she can go stay with the women in her family. Divorce wasn’t common. But in one of the documents it was mentioned how she was taken as a slave by one of the warlords that exploited the chaos of the Anglo-Ashanti war. So she didn’t have that connection. She could be simply sold for profit.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Zo: Kevin?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Kevin: I assume that this is an extremely patriarchal society. I noticed how nonchalantly Abina speaks of herself being sold or being forced to marry. The normality of it was disturbing. It was easy for a man to do this at this time. Regarding the beads, what Grace referred to is also about maturing into adulthood. I didn’t think of it like that. Kind of makes sense. The way I viewed it was that beads and jewelry are a symbol of wealth and status. If you cut it off maybe you’re de-escalating on the social ladder. I could be wrong. Abina said, “... the only thing that was done was the cutting of the beads at that time.” That’s why I think it was a symbol of being a slave. That’s how I interpreted it.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Zo: Thank you, Sua?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Sua: I think we can understand this relationship of marriage as a hierarchy. It’s not between men and women as equals. The husband took the wife as, similar to the concept of servant, or somebody below their own status. Cutting the beads also symbolizes the woman has become more adept for reproduction and may symbolize that she is now more easily used as a means of reproduction. I think we can understand it in those terms.</p><p dir="ltr">Zo: Jacqueline?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Jacqueline: I agree with Anusha and what Sua said about the beads. I think, yes, marriage was something that could be purchased, but I don’t think that when it comes to the “purchaser's”’ perspective, I don’t think the beads meant much in terms of economic value, but they had a huge symbolic meaning for the women. Progression of becoming a woman… more important for that symbolic value. I don’t think that the cutting of the beads is exactly related to their status as a slave or not.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Zo: The last question, Rahaa…</p><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: Hossein is my official name, it’s mine, I can’t actually find it. Can you read it on my behalf?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Zo: “Colonialism is remembered as a destructive phenomenon that had disempowered many peoples, leaving behind a dark blotch in the history books of the colonized nations. However, the British were, by the late eighteenth century, the biggest proponents of the slavery’s abolishment globally. Abina is a case in point of one of the many individuals who were liberated from the fell clutch of a despotic society by the British. What significance knowing this fact have when looking back at the legacies of imperialism and colonialism? Was the British empire truly evil? Or did it also contribute positively to humankind?” Anybody? Ali?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Ali: I believe that with any empire in the world, can’t be just good and bad. Every empire in the world has its positive contributions but also their atrocities. They were one of the top slave-holding empires in their history, concentration camps in Africa. Can’t deny these positive effects. Leaders in the abolition of the slave trade. Depends on how we view the balance of positive and negative effects.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Zo: Simena?&nbsp;</p>Simena: Can’t be black and white, but if an empire is known for their slavery, evil overpowers the good. Development, maybe by force, maybe voluntarily. When the general public knows them for having such a strong history of slavery. More leaning towards evil. <br>

                    When discussing the abolishment of slavery, one could argue that it was one of the hardest achievements that black people had to accomplish. Moreover, the number of court trials that people had to experience cannot be undermined. In the court transcript of Abina Mansah, Mansah portrays how she has been a slave under the defendant. However, one can see how Mansah changes her response for questions; why does Mansah do this, and how does the changed responses affect her position in court?<br><br>
                    First, Mansah changes her response when she was asked if she was called by any names by Eccoah. Mansah first claims that she was not actually called a slave. However, as the question varies, Mansah’s response changes, saying that Eccoah “treated [her] as a slave and called [her] a slave.”  Compared to the first response, her tone changes to certainty, giving specific answers. However, it can be reasonable to think that she is manipulating her responses by the support of Melton, to place herself in a lower position. Therefore, Mansah may have been exaggerating herself in the context.<br><br>
                    Second, Mansah changes her response when she was asking if she knew that she was free. Starting from the response that she “did not know”, her response is revealed, saying that she “[knew] that all are free”.  The tone changes abruptly during this dialogue, where her final response almost completely contrasts. However, why did Mansah change her response if it made her position more disadvantageous? It can be reasonable to think that since Mansah is under pressure, and Brew asks in a way to pull out answers from her, Mansah accidentally revealed the truth during the court. If this is the case, I believe that this dialogue would have acted disadvantageously upon her, as her credibility has already dropped.<br><br>

                      The first idea that I thought of is to revisit how Ghana won their independence from Britain in 1947. Reading through articles, I found out that there were two different perspectives towards the independence, where one was if gold coast was decolonized by Britain since Britain lost their power, or if Ghana won their independence by protesting and rebelling towards Britain. Both statements make sense as Britain was indeed in huge debt to the United States during the post-World War Two period, and they were opposed from expanding their territories in Europe. At the same time, the rising of new generation of African nationalists who wanted to overthrow the colonialism instead of reforming it started rebelling, which made Britain to retreat from their once owned colonies. Therefore, I would like to research about which statement is more significant, whether the sudden collapse of Britain’s economy or the rise in power of Ghana’s government enabled their independence in gold coast. Further on, with the conclusion that I have reached, I would like to research on other supporting factors that made each statement stronger. For example, if I chose to conclude that it was the rise in power of Ghana that enabled independence, I could further write about Convention People’s Party, or the role that woman played that made the Ghanian government stronger. On the other hand, if I chose the other option, I could write about their defeat in the war, specifically Japan’s wartime victories against Britain, or about the United States’ rising global influence and their opposition to imperialism after the war. However, a concern of this topic could be that the scale is too big, as it includes both independence of gold coast and World War 2.<br><br>
                      Another research paper idea could be about what events happened after Ghana’s independence, and what influence Ghana’s influence had to other African countries. For this topic, I tried to focus on the point that Ghana was the first to declare independence from European colonialism, and that other African countries were also motivated to declare independence. Moreover, political reformation after the independence or various movements and campaigns could also be included. However, a concern with this topic can be that the topic is not purely focusing on Ghana but on other countries as well. Also, the scope can be too small to write a 6 to 8 page research paper.<br><br>

                  <p><b></b></p><p dir="ltr">Anusha: We’re doing this a little differently this time, one question from each category at a time. Category 1, 2, and 3, then it repeats. We wanted to respect everyone’s questions in the best way possible. Starting with Jana, could you read your question?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: What exactly made the authors see their own country or people as so advanced and superior that they put all others below them and considered them inferior? Where did the obsession with dominating all other "uncivilized" countries and compulsive enforcing their civilization come from? (Jana Leonie)</p><br><p dir="ltr">Anusha: Any takers? Grace?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Grace: I think that for the first part, the reason that many Europeans authors that we’ve read so far have argued that their country, or European countries as a group, are better than many other places in the world is because of nationalism and how, in that time, it wasn’t looked down on (like in America today), but a deep sense of loyalty. Bled into other aspects of their lives, influenced this belief in a superior country and race.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Anusha: Great point, anybody else? Kevin?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: So, what Grace brought up about nationalism is interesting. We saw the documentary, the need to increase territory with the increased population. They needed some kind of intellectual justification to do that. They had to convince themselves that it was correct, righteous, and acceptable. That’s where the rhetoric came from. These nationalistic tendencies could have fueld these bigoted beliefs. The emergence of science could play a part in this. The discovery of evolution and species. Could make people think that we could objectively “prove” that superiority. This scientific discovery motivated these attempts to prove a superior race. Social Darwinism played a part.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Anusha: Definitely, yeah. Zo?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Zo: All the advances in culture, government, science happened in the Middle Ages, Europeans used to voyage to Africa and Asia, saw how different civilizations lived, made them think that they were superior, better than everyone. The scientific features of studying skulls, they used that scientific knowledge to justify that they were superior.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Anusha: Nabi?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: I also think that the long history of Europe contributed to this. They think that they’re the major race. The Roman Empire or Persian Empire, contributed to that statement. I also could say that Europeans were superior and developed, more than other countries in the world, which explains why Europeans considered black people as a lower race of humanity.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Anusha: Great point, if there’s nobody else, I can move to the second category and question… theory of evolution and its impact on imperialism. RAhaa, could you read your question?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: How did the discovery of the fact of evolution, and the natural selection (survival of the fittest) theory describing its functionality change how European societies' intellectuals and plebeians viewed Africans? Has the discovery of our humble origins caused a paradigmatic shift in the said societies? (Rahaa)</p><br><p dir="ltr">Anusha: Anybody? Rahaa?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: What we saw in the documentary, in the early days, there was strong religious opposition to the theory, by the early 1900s, there were more and more nationalists and imperialists to justify their own rule of terror in the colonies, to clear their own conscience of guilt. It was used by Nazis to justify what they were doing with the racial exterminations that took place on the continent of Europe. Later, I heard this from Professor Denton, the scientific discovery of the gene that caused the skin to turn black. First homo sapiens… from there, emigrated to other parts of the world. Common ancestors who were black, this helped to counter that theory racial supremacy.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Anusha: Jusang?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: On this point, social Darwinism coming from the theory of evolution, “survival of the fittest,” was used by Europeans--at least the intellectuals--as a way to justify themselves, but I’m not sure how those ideas were spread to the common people. Maybe visual propaganda? In terms of a paradigmatic shift, it made Europeans think that they were in this benevolent position, a force that was bringing civilization to parts of the world that lacked it. It made them see themselves as more omnipotent, used to justify their mission as a superior race, bringing the merits of “high culture and civilization” to inferior ones.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Anusha: Sua?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: I think that what Darwin intended, at the first, in the Descent of Man, was to escape from the original human-centric focus. Points out that humans are descended from “lower” species. But it’s problematic that he chose the word “lower,” a hierarchy in the animals. Lower species similar to native Americans or Africans, that implication meant that those who read the book thought that they were inferior, others were less evolved, and they were superior.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Anusha: Kevin? Then we’ll move on to the next question.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: The discussion of religion that RAhaa asked reminded me of Professor Ratnapalan’s topics in intellectual history, and we’ve talked about Darwin. AT the time of its publication, the power and significance of religion in society was diminished. He mentions that his ideas are irreligious. There weren’t enough churches to house these people. Period of rapid change. Makes me wonder why Christians thought slavery was OK. If you think of slavery, it’s pretty anti-Christian if you think about it. And maybe the decrease of the prominence of religion made things worse, maybe? I’m not sure, something I’d like to learn about.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Anusha: Thank you Kevin, I’ll be passing along the symbolic baton to Simena.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: Jusang, can you read your question?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: In Burroughs' story, Tarzan had refused to eat an African man who he had just killed. Would the "human conscience" shown here be attributed to him being a human being or a white man specifically, and why would Burroughs have included this section in the story? (Jusang)</p><br><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: Any takers?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Denton: This is a very important question, it might take some time… can you figure this out?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: Eugene?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: I think it’s alluding to “human nature.” Even though he hadn’t learned it, it was a “hereditary” instinct that stopped him from cannibalism. Maybe it speaks to something, a quality that makes us all human. And it’s a good thing, that’s what I took from it.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: Zo?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Zo: In this section, I think it’s associated with “human conscience,” he’s never been a part of that civilization, he’s not aware of it. He wouldn’t have been aware of other races, white supremacy and other stuff. But in the story as a whole, Burroughs added that Tarzan--even though he was living among animals--learned how to read and write. That was to show that white men were better, no matter in what environment he’s living. Intellectually more advanced than anyone else.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: Interesting insight, Kyeyoung?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: I think the main question is that if he says that the African man, is a man, you shouldn’t eat him, trying to show that Tarzan is different from these African men, he can read, name these animals, read and write, these sort of things, puts Tarzan in a position from the African man, a “better human being.” But, at the same time, they’re both men. Maybe the author has conflicted views on these issues. I thought that Burroughs did think the Africans should be different than Tarzan, the “ideal savage,” while the other African men are not.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: Kevin?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: “Ideal savage,” is an interesting cooly worded term. It reminded me of Darwin again, even though we look like this, in the beginning we came from this lower type of creature. What makes man, man is a moral conscience or intellect. Even though we come from beasts, even though we are beasts, what differentiates us from barbaric nature, is distinguishing right from one. Maybe cannibalism is the line that one has to cross to be a savage or barbarian. It’s associated with colored people, movies like “Cannibal Holocaust,” even contemporary movies, “... Infero,” maybe that’s where this comes from. I think that was the author’s intention.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: Grace?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Asdf: I don’t have much new to add, but maybe a reason why Burroughs chose this particular stereotype, but Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, mid to late 1800s, in it, the protagonist encounters a tribe that practices cannibalism. What Kevin was saying about cannibalism as a popular motif, in western society, the author chose this particular thing to focus on. Further support his point about the clear difference intrinsically.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: Jusang?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: I wanted to point out some direct comparisons in the text. For example, “the blacks soldiers of the white man had meat aplenty,” that implies that they ate the bodies of the warriors that they previously killed. They specifically implied that the tribespeople here are cannibals. He has this impulse that prevents him from eating his fellow man, it’s a “hereditary instinct.” I can relate this back to the mindset that Europeans were expressing pity towards the Afircans, fellow men, but they don’t see each other as so. Maybe intended to highlight that in terms of morals, Europeans are “hereditarily superior” to others, in terms of treating fellow men like men. That makes Tarzan’s “white man” aspect stronger, than him doing it as a human impulse. Refusing to eat that black man. White man = human being in general? Maybe.&nbsp;</p><br>Simena: I think we’re out of time. <br>

                    Darwin’s Theory of Evolution: How Science’s Greatest Gift Was Mankind’s Worst Curse<br><br><br><br>
                    Of the numerous scientific advancements and breakthroughs that emerged during the age of imperialism, Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution was one of the most influential. However, this theory came with a, in many ways, negative side effect, the idea of “Social Darwinism”. This is the application of Darwin’s theory onto human beings as well, stating that “survival of the fittest” also applies to humans, and not simply animals and plants. Throughout history, this concept was used to racially segregate humans, and this segregation was particularly apparent in its adoption by European rulers to justify their awful treatment of Africans and natives in the Americas. Through his consequential, yet controversial, research, Darwin caused more harm than good in terms of ethical development during the era of colonialism.<br><br>
                    The negative effects of Darwin’s writing can partially be attributed to the underlying racism in his writings. This racism is seen on multiple occasions, particularly in his description of the Fuegians. Darwin, referencing the Fuegians, states, “They possessed hardly any arts, and like wild animals lived on what they could catch; they had no government and were merciless to every one not of their small tribe.”  This description that regarded them as lesser humans would have certainly also played a role in readers’ perceptions of natives in South America. Furthermore, his writing’s effects would have been magnified through their usage by Sir Harry Johnston in his book The Backward Peoples and Our Relations With Them. In the book, Sir Johnston performs a mathematical evaluation and ranking of races in different parts of Europe and Africa in terms of factors including their religion, education, and manner of government to name a few. This troubling ideology was enabled by figures such as Darwin, who, purposefully or accidentally, reinforced these racial stereotypes by claiming their scientific validity.

                  <p><b></b></p><p dir="ltr">Kevin: The first topic is “Heart of Darkness and Conrad’s ideology”. Jacqueline, could you read your question?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jacqueline: “Why did Conrad use words like "savage" and "criminals" to identify black people when he concluded that they weren't "savages" or "criminals" at the end of the passage? Were these words supposed to incite a reaction from his audience?”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: I thought that it was something internalized, having grown up in an environment where people were classified that way. When he sees the slaves working, he has an internal dilemma, but he can’t shake those internalized terms.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: There’s a nuanced, internal trouble. Next, Grace?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Grace: I agree with Simena, I think he uses those terms to contrast what he was perceiving in their behaviors and their general features, by calling them savages. But, the narrator in the book makes the audience question if they’re really savages if they act like humans. That’s part of the reason.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Maybe there’s not that much of a difference. Good point, next, Eugene?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: I think it’s the conflict of being told one thing and then finding out something else for yourself. His company says they’re enemies, he goes there, finds out that they’re not. Miserable condition. He says that they’re part of this “soulless, monotonous system,” and I think he thought “how could they possibly be enemies when their company puts them in such abject misery.” Clash between what he was told.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Cognitive dissonance. The words are like, “sordid,” grimness… anyone else?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: If not, Sua, can you read your question?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: “Should we, as modern readers, consider the periodic limitations of these texts (ex: Conrad indicating black people as 'savage') as something inevitable? Or should those limitations should also be criticized? With what view should we assess the historical texts and arguments regarding racial issues?”&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Any takers? Ali?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: We’ve been discussing this particular topic, since we’ve started this class. In what perspective should we look at these older texts that have racial overtones. Heart of Darkness is, at its core, a horrifying account of the treatment of Africans in the Congo, it’s anticolonial and anti imperial, Conrad was never--at least consciously--a supporter of the European colonialists. It’s controversial from a modern perspective, but people in the future are going to look at us as racist or having questionable morals.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Fifty years from now, people will see us that way.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: I agree with Ali. Up until this point, we didn’t really think about what Europeans thought about this situation, in their country. In the King Leopold text, it says that the people “silently condemn him” but they don’t want to “stain” the royalty, that they have to be loyal to the king. That’s a new way of thinking about it for me, shows the European awareness of what was happening.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Royal privilege makes him impartial to criticism. Kyeyoung?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: From these documents, we’re viewing Africans from a very European perspective. The reason why we see the limitations, because we don’t have source documents from the victims. The AFricans who were enslaved. These documents from the Europeans were interesting, making a change in morality. I was looking at the document for the Heart of Darkness. There’s a consensus that it was a way for Europeans to move forward, changed perception of how Africans were treated. It created a linguistic change. But isn’t that unimportant from the sense of the victims. Aren’t we focusing too much on the point of view of the perpetrators?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: The discourse is very one-sided, white people squabbling amongst each other. Not a lot of African voices here.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Minsoo: Not sure how to respond to Kyeyoung, but a lot of the points that came up are that the intention of Heart of Darkness is anti colonialist. If we wanted to have a better understanding, it would help to read other texts from this time period to see if words like “savage” and so on are being used and how offensive they were. Reading other texts would help give a context.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: To see the trend, yeah. Eugene?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Thinking about Kyeyoung’s comments and why all of these authors were intent on criticizing the Belgian Congo. There were awful things being done. But, King Leopold’s comment, in the text, “other European nations have colonies,” probably wasn’t as awful as the Congo, there were questionable things being done. Why did they jump on the Congo? That was something that needed to be explored. You have to understand what’s going on outside of it.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: It is, need to consider all perspectives and circumstances. Interesting question, we found out that “oh, this author isn’t racist, but should we hold them accountable or treat them as a product of their time.” Happened really recently from Margaret Atwood, my favorite author, bigotted comments, but she’s 80… Rahaa, could you read your question?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: “Is the Heart of Darkness against or for European Colonialism in Africa?”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Any takers?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: The research that I did on this question, I realize at the time of publication, 1899, many Europeans knew what was happening in the heart of the continent of Africa, the Congo, and they were leading these leisure-based lives, if there was something happening, some sort of punishment, the government would say it’s Just the criminals and “savages” being punished. These texts, it’s a work of fiction, important to distinguish between Conrad’s views and Marlowe’s views. Conrad’s a character himself, throughout the book, his views change. He describes, he reflects, and makes his own judgments. In my opinion, this book greatly helped in changing the status quo in AFrica, less like “wringing the country” to extract as much profit as possible. Make it a little more humane. But also, one other thing, Edward Morel, the leader of the CRA (Congo Reform Association), wasn't against European colonialism. He was more paternalistic, as their “white fathers,” they should be more humane towards these black African peoples. They only wanted a change in attitude.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Even though the prose is discriminatory, he has a nuanced take, but is anti colonial. Sua?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: It’s definitely against colonialism. It shows that Europeans aren’t the “more civilized” people, and unveils the reality of what was going on in the Congo. It enlightens, or gives new information about the violent realities of what was going on in the Congo. And in other areas.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: A new perspective. Minsoo?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Minsoo: I just wanted to add that I think it is a little difficult just from the excerpt whether it’s for or against, but I think if we were to read the entire novel, we could answer that question. But if it is against colonialism, it would be interesting to check whether its out of pity or compassion for the Congolese or because of the effect of colonialism on the Europeans and how that changes them. I think the fact that the main character is not Congolese shows us how it affected the Europeans, and not the Congolese themselves and the atrocities committed against them.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Yes, definitely need to think about his motives. Nabi?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: I wanted to add that this work mentioned the economic exploitation in the Congo, the main reason for the colonialism that appeared in the Heart of Darkness. Ivory, mining, forced labor of the natives. This idea shows how the author was against colonialism.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: I think we’re leaning to the argument that it's against colonialism. Grace?<br><br></p><p dir="ltr">Grace: The title, Heart of Darkness, during the story, he’s going deeper and deeper into the Congo State, it represents the evil that’s happening but also the lack of knowledge. Conrad is trying to expose what’s happening, and show how dark colonialism can be.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Not a literary lack of light, but lack of knowledge, insight. Valid interpretation. Next question will be Eugene. Can you read it?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: “It’s clear that Conrad regarded the place that he was being sent to as a desolate, delirious place (due to its weather). Why would the Company send people out to such a place?” What does that tell us about the socio-economic nature of the men being sent out to these places?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Jusang?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: I think that not Conrad himself, but Marlowe, it tries to give the readers a better sense of the oppressive, suffering atmosphere. That’s why Conrad talked about the weather and environment this way, the malevolence of the weather sets the atmosphere as a place of constant suffering and death. It’s stylistic. Makes it easier for the population to accept suffering. Similar to Tarzan, spreading ideas to the common population. As to the second part of the question, jobs that require people to go to these places, those that are quite desperate. Like gold rushes in various countries. People flock there for monetary gain. In terms of sheer economic status, there wouldn't have people of wealth or stature, unless it’s political or business. Mostly low socio-economic status. Earning money is probably the first priority.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Like a really extreme profession. We should move on. Nabi, could you read your question out loud? This is the next section: Mark Twain and his anonymous vilifier</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: “In the works of Mark Twain, there are some ideas that show how colonization caused negative consequences which are likely to be suppressed by the government. Why did European countries let mass media (books, works, etc) expose the reality of colonization in Africa?”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Takers? No?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jessica: I think there might be several reasons. First, it was not about criticizing the general concept of colonization, but condemning one dictator’s evil deeds. Also, his way of ruling the Congo was not a normal form of colonization, for the benefit of Belgium. He tried to do it for his own profit. That kind of criticism could be acceptable for many Europeans.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Difficult to silence popular rhetoric. Sehwee?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: I’ve always considered the western societies to have a higher appreciation towards expressing their thoughts. Not sure what censorship was like, but an influential author like Twain could say what he thought.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Was Twain famous when he was alive? [Denton nodding…] May have had that authority and popularity. Sua?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: I think the government could have allowed that criticism, against Leopold, “oh, Belgium is so bad, so violent, we are better, more benevolent.” It’s a political act to make the public think like that.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Ah, yeah, right. Twain is an American author. NOt weird for an American to criticize another country. Next question, Anusha?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Anusha: “If Mark Twain were to comment on "An Answer to Mark Twain," what would he have likely said?” I know that the consensus that “An Answer” was baseless and ridiculous. Is there anything in there that Twain might agree with? Or us?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Any takers? Simena?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: I’m not sure if this is really agreeing, but in the answer to Mark Twain, if he’s exposing things in the Congo, he should expose other things. I don’t think the author of the answer wanted to expose Twain… maybe Twain would agree that he should expose others.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Maybe Twain would find some of those criticisms valid. If nobody else, we can move forward. Ali?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: “This week's documents displayed two major figures, E.D. Morel and Mark Twain, campaigning for the rights of Africans. To what extent could the dawn of mass media during that era have helped contribute to the improvement of human rights in Africa? Could the writers and their works have been suppressed by the empires of the time?”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Zo?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Zo: I’ve been reading about Casement, the British missionary who exposed those diaries and photographs. By doing so, these reports really let the rest of Europeans know what was going on in the Congo. His support was vital. Helping the Congo to get rid of the Free State rule was very important. It was a very important step for human rights in Africa. I don’t think the works were suppressed by the Belgians, but the Europeans at the time didn’t know what was going on. This kind of work opened their eyes.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Age of photography, people could take photos, concrete evidence. simena?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: Not sure about the first part of the question. King Leopold, has a “childish stance” on photography, upset that there’s finally visual proof. Could writers be suppressed, yes, but with visual proof, a new era has been opened.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Yes, so, in my research, there was this person called Alice Sealy Harris who took a lot of these photographs. Very important. Minsoo?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Minsoo: So, I agree with what was said about photography. In the Twain text there’s the mention of the Kodak, concerning whether it would have been suppressed at the time, I think it would have been. It’s similar to the place that social media has in our society these days. With Twitter, we can expose things in real time. INformation flows so quickly, but at the same time there are ways to censor that from people in positions of power. Some level of censorship.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Some kind of suppression. If there are no other people, we can move to the next question. Kyeyoung?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: My question… “Is the intention of Mark Twain purely for the sake of black people, or are there any political motivations?”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: We kind of discussed this earlier, but any takers? Nobody? Ali?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: From my reading of it, I don’t think that he had ulterior motives, though perhaps he was trying to reach more people with these writings. He took action against it. He was a prominent speaker in this movement, against imperialism at that time. He was mainly championing the freedom movement. Also, the satirical approach might have led him to be more acceptable. Many politicians use that today. He was trying to go against this very dark imperialism and colonialism at that time.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: If there aren’t others, we can move to the next question. Let’s go to the next category, King Leopold and the public perception of colonialism. Simena, can you read your question?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: “Despite there now being visual proof exposing his actions of exploiting Congolese natives, King Leopold is still certain that people will not lose loyalty to him. How can we relate this statement to the lack of public uprisings against the kings' atrocious acts, and how did this shape the history of slavery and our modern perception of these events? Would there have been a different outcome had there a strong opposition, rather than loyalty with a hint of shame that made the public turn a blind eye?” What I meant with this question was the loyalty for King Leopold.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Any takers? Eugene?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: This is not a direct answer to Simena’s question, but it’s important to keep in mind that this is a particular viewpoint. We’re looking at the viewpoint of Mark Twain. It’s a bit of fiction and his own point of view added to this situation. We shouldn’t assume these statements are a default fact or something. I think that’s what I wanted to mention. If you recognize that it’s some fiction and embellishment.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Zo?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Zo: Leopold didn’t face opposition because before he took over the Congo, he was a hero of the Belgians as making it a powerhouse in Europe. He was a hero for the Belgians. He wasn’t faced with much opposition. He’s still viewed that way by some Belgians.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Manseok?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Manseok: I agree with the point that citizens were blinded by their loyalty. And I agree that there might have been a different outcome if they had known, one of the main reasons was that they didn’t know. If more knew, and were thinking, there would have been a different outcome.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Sua?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: I have a little different opinion. I think the Belgian people would have had some information and may have morally criticized him a little, but the benefits from colonization would have made them not want to overthrow him.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Next question, Zo, could you read your question out loud?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Zo: “What was the Belgian people's attitude towards their king at the time? Couldn't the people overthrow the king as his actions benefited not the society but only the king himself?” This was before I read about Leopold’s effect on the BElgian people.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Any takers? Simena?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: This is connected to my question. In the TWain document, “if a Christian king . . . what comfort he can get out of his confession.” I feel like this quote illustrates the view that the Belgians had for their king, there’s a strong religious component. They’re aware of what he’s doing, but they feel a need to protect him, because of that religious aura that surrounds him.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: One last speaker, Minsoo?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Minsoo: I thought Simena’s point was interesting but I thought that maybe that people weren’t openly in opposition was simply that the Congo was so far away. Even with issues happening within your country, if you don’t see it immediately, they don’t take action. They would have been aware, but not willing to take immediate action. It doesn’t justify their indifference, but helps to explain it. The same nowadays.&nbsp;</p><br><br>

                  Inherent Duality in the Description of Black People in Heart of Darkness<br><br><br><br>
                  Heart of Darkness written by Joseph Conrad, reflecting the author’s own experience of visiting Congo, provides a highly detailed description of Congolese and the Europeans exploiting them. These details pose the duality of the author’s perspective; while attacking European imperialism’s naked nature, the author fails to remove the instilled stereotypes about Africans.<br><br>
                  The vivid portrayal in Heart of Darkness discloses the violent and indifferent nature of European imperialism, at the same time unveiling the suffering circumstance of Congo. In the 19th century, occupying a better position within international relationships and making money out of colonizing other lands only mattered. Conrad explains this overheated competition of interest by mentioning that “nobody seemed particularly to care” about people drowning in the surf, highlighting the indifference toward individuals’ rights or lives.  He also illuminates who sacrifices from this violence and how they suffer by describing the black people he encountered without any omissions. His word choice of “enemies,” “criminals,” and the illustration of black people “dying slowly” presents Congolese being exploited and suffering from it.  It is noticeable that the author includes his self-reflection in the narrative, confessing that he “also was a part of the great cause,” not escaping from the responsibility of European imperialism. <br><br>
                  However, Conrad’s realistic description brought a counter effect—it emphasized and left an impression of the very racial characteristics that Europeans used to justify their imperialism. His word choice of “savage,” “white … eyeballs,” “grotesque masks” represents the initial shock and sense of physical difference that Europeans felt in their first encounter with Africans, and Conrad, in his process of reporting in full detail, fails to remove his stereotypical perspective.  The problematic probability of this perspective reinforcing the image of Africans instilled within Europeans’ minds does not help in improving the perception that Africans, still barbarians, cannot become equal with Europeans.

                  <p><b></b></p><p dir="ltr">Jana: Let’s start with Simena, can you read your question?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: The first part is background, then the question is at the end. In the "With the Nigerians in German East Africa" text, the author starts off his writing with the aim of conveying the greatness of Nigerian soldiers, using words like "black volunteers" to describe their service for "the empire"; however, in the following text, the interview with Malawian soldiers, they express their disdain for fighting in the war and how they were in it for the money, and how much rather they would've wanted to stay with their families instead of, in their words, "shedding blood far away from their land for a cause that isn't their own." Could there really have been a difference in perception between Europeans and Africans about their military service, and were Europeans truly under the impression that Africans were doing this willingly for "the empires?" Or did Europeans use expressions such as "volunteer" and "sacrifice" to cover for the fact that they were using soldiers in a war that didn't directly impact them?”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Rahaa?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: The British empire did only use volunteers, the French empire used a combination of volunteers and constriction. But the British empire, that you’re citing in your question, from the British captain. I think the British, what they did, really identified these African communities that had a high concentration of former runaway slaves, so they knew that they’d be willing to fight for them. They also exploited the honor culture of African societies. They were brainwashed into thinking that if they went to war, they would become men. The idea that if they returned they would become more masculine.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Anyone else? Sehwee?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: I believe that they intentionally hid the fact that they were receiving some kind of reward or honor, because it was a method to glorify their sacrifices. I’m not sure why th8ey tried to glorify it, because it’s blatantly racist. But there’s an attempt to make them seem more virtuous than they actually were.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: &nbsp;If there are no others, we can move on to the next question? Rahaa?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: “(Rahaa) the British colonial troops consisted exclusively of volunteers, while the French recruitment policy in North and West Africa was a mixed one,</p><p dir="ltr">including the enlistment of volunteers as well as conscription. Besides the African soldiers who were conscripted, what possible incentives could have made Africans to volunteer to fight in the Great war?”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Simena?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Asdf: I feel like this closely ties to my question. I think there were three main reasons. First, because they targeted lower class groups, instead of craftsmen or people with businesses. Second, because of government coercion, targeted people that were evading taxes and to protect their land. I think that’s the main thing that goes through all of the documents. They keep reciting this over and over, they’ll serve anybody for the sake of protecting their country.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Ali?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: I totally agree with Simena, and want to point out the quote from the Nyasaland text. They were really loyal to their country, their land. Yes, they needed the money, but they felt the need to protect their land, their nation. For sure.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Zo?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Zo: Besides these financial incentives, in the text, it mentions that African people finally proved themselves as a “man”. Maybe they volunteered to prove their worth as human beings, to kind of avenge their centuries of oppression by the Europeans, by fighting in their wars successfully, to justify their worth.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Thank you, anyone else? If not, we’ll move to Jusang’s question.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: Would Africans who volunteered during the war have felt that being soldiers was a path to increasing their status? Did the generally positive recounts of their valor incentivize them to join the military?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Thank you, any thoughts? Yes, Simena?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: I don’t know about increasing their status, but they definitely did join because of them “being blinded by the parades.” There were a lot of positive connotations presented to them. I don’t know if it increased their status in any way.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Yeah, Rahaa?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: I specifically studied African volunteers in the British army. This definitely did happen. The British army officers boosted their morale by having them believe that they were worthy, not inferior people, but when they came back to their own places, I remember reading that women would swoon over them. The war did greatly help these soldiers have a higher social status if they made it back alive, to their communities. If you made it, you’d have a better life, money, and respect.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Ali?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: We see in the documents, these images of the three Africans who were given the Legion of Honor. I don’t know if they were told previously if they could gain those honors, maybe the French used them as an incentive. But honors that made them well known in their communities.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Anyone else, the next question is similar to the previous ones, so I’ll skip that and go to Manseok’s question. Could you please read it?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Manseok: Downes points out that troops from Africa were recruited voluntarily, but Melvin in his interviews point out that some people were forced to join the war, and that the chief and headmen threatened their position if they were not able to recruit enough people. Does this mean that recruitment was not voluntary, and if so, why did Europeans present it as if it was a voluntary act?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Kyeyoung?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: So, what I wanted to point out was that Downes, I think, does say that they were sort of asked to go. In the connotation, reading between the lines, that sort of “asking the Africans to go to war,” but from their perspective it was very forceful. But from the Eruopeans perspective it wasn’t as forceful, maybe because of hte language involved. I think I read along the lines that the Africans would have gone if they were ordered, and if they were ordered, they went. There’s also the evidence of going home… It suggests in some way that they were forced, or at least coerced, but the Europeans didn’t acknowledge, or even really know what the Africans were saying.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Sua?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: I’d like to answer the second part of hte question. I think it comes from their sense of being benevolent. Europeans saw themselves as being “the most developed, evolved human species,” with the Enlightenment, equality, freedom, they couldn’t say that they forced fellow humans, or maybe they wanted to present themselves as being civilized, people who cared about equality.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Nabi, then we’ll move on to the next question.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: The illustrations have a particular pattern [audio cut out]... and I think that most Europeans decided that it was an invitation for Europeans to show them in this way, to encourage other African soldiers to join the war. [missed] In the way that they joined the war involuntarily, the least amount of Africans would join the war. That’s why I think that the Europeans wanted to show AFrican soldiers that they could join the war voluntarily.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Thank you. The next question is from Sehwee. Can you read your question?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Even after their service, why were Nigerians discriminated against? Considering the Downes text shows gratitude to such Nigerians, the discrimination feels extra weird.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Thoughts on that? Jusang?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: I’d say that it’s because they saw the Nigerians as “expendable,” useful in times of war when you need extra manpower. When that’s not needed, they’re relegated to second class subjects of the empire. All of this kind of talk about respecting these soldiers of Africa, came out in times of war. These circumstances most likely constantly changed the status and treatment that these Africans received from society.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Jacqueline?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jacqueline: I agree with Jusang, but I don’t think we should forget how close all of our sources were, in terms of when they were produced and the time period. We did talk about Darwinism in some of our previous texts, specifically those outlooks on Africans. Although AFricans did receive, in general, not specifically Nigerians, they got an increase in status, but they might have only been respected in those standpoints. But overall, Europeans were still led to believe that African people were still “inferior” because of the still prevalent Social darwinism that a lot of Europeans were led to believe or were taught by previous writers and philosophers. We should remember that these ideas informed how they viewed Africans.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Zo?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Zo: I agree with Jacqueline. I don’t believe that he discriminated against them intentionally. Looking down on AFricans as inferior, for them was seen as “conventional truth” or “natural,” so as Jacqueline said, they were taught or raised to think that Africans were naturally inferior.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Eugene?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: The question for me was how AFricans seemed to have certain responsibilities or duties as a citizen, but the question is how many rights they had. Was there any reciprocity? That’s what I questioned. Some of them were taxed, in some texts, in others they were sent to war or encouraged to go to war. If it is indeed “your country,” and you’re serving, you should get something in return… respect or something else.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Thank you, Nabi, then Simena, then we’ll move on.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: In my point of view, they were forced to put pressure on Africans by discriminating [audio cutting out], most Europeans were concerned that African participation in the war would produce change in Africa itself. Encouraging an African intelligentsia. This is something that I found in my Selected Bibliography. [audio cutting out]&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Simena?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: A lot of good points were made. I wanted to point out the quote, “east is east, west is west, and never the twain shall meet.” Before the quote he praises them, then after the quote, he completely bashes them. Applying this to the question, he’s aware. It’s not what he’s taught, but if he can make such a differentiation, he’s aware of what he’s trying to imply by discriminating against them.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: One more question from this section, Ali, can you read your question?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: Through this week's documents such as the "Illustrations of Portraits of African Troops", we can see an added respect given to Africans by some Europeans. Given that we discussed the horrors of Belgian Congo and the damaging effects of Social Darwinism, what caused this sort of shift in perception towards Africans? Or were the Europeans simply desperate for more troops?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Thank you. Any opinions? Rahaa?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: In France, the general public wasn’t supportive of colonialism, but when they saw all of these volunteers, they became positive towards their colonial subjects and colonialism in general. The fact that many volunteers contributed to that change in perception.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Thank you, anyone else? Sua?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: It could have been a way to mitigate their protest. There might have been protests from Africans or other races, Europeans might have decided to adopt a new kind of approach, when conscripting or sending them to war. We respect you, we think you’re doing a great job, contributing to our civilization. A little hypocritical, but worked as an approach.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Thank you, any other thoughts? OK, so, if not, we will move on to the next question. Oh wait, that’s mine. I’ll read my own question. “To what extent can differences in the way Europeans and Africans think to be identified? Are there any differences at all concerning military service and how it is perceived?” Simena?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: One thing that came to mind was that for Europeans it’s about conquering, for Africans, it’s about defending. There’s subordination. But the one thing they would share is a sense of honor.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Sua?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: Europeans and Africans would have thought very differently about warfare. In Europe, mobilization of an entire society, killing each other, but in Africa, there would have been warfare, but at a smaller scale. Their perception might have differed.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: If I could add my own comment to that. What came to mind when I read that text was that for the Eruopeans, going to war and conquering new land was an adventure to them, nothing really serious, but for the Africans, it was fighting for their own land. If “their masters'' lost the war, they would lose as well. For the Europeans it felt more like a Sunday afternoon activity. I think we’ll move on to the next question. Jessica?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jessica: Although there were proportionately very few ads using Black characters during World War I, why would Pierre Lardet, Banania brand founder, advertised his product with a Senegalese soldier, not with a European?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Anyone? Kyeyoung?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: This is a very interesting question. I think the first reason why is that the product, according to Wikipedia, is a cocoa drink. We relate to it being black. They might have used the African soldier. The second reason is that it would have garnered some European responses, maybe like “noise marketing.” That’s my two cents.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Jusang?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: Probably because they wanted to market it as a drink used in times of war, also, I heard from somewhere that the term, “y’a bon,” it’s a pigeon language, a washed down version. It gives an image of a soft, but not unintelligent, harmless African character, in order to make the product more friendly and warm. Using the stigma as an appeal.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Jacqueline?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jacqueline: “Y’a bon” means it’s good. But why would they advertise a French breakfast? The thing that crossed my mind first was that they used African characters in their advertisements to show that Banania was nourishing for their African soldiers. I think that African soldiers, or the connotation, meant that the French had a strong army. I think that’s why they used black soldiers in their advertisements.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Nabi?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Most factories during that time, focused on food and necessary products for soldiers. This representation demonstrates how the target for those products were African peoples. I think that’s why most companies wanted to show black people in their advertisements.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana:&nbsp; Let’s skip to Kyeyoung’s question, really quick.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: How would the existence of African troops affect Europe long-term? (In terms of demographic, attitudes, politics etc in Europe today) Why is the African troops not discussed more?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Ali?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: All answer the second part first. History is remembered by those who write it. Unfortunately, the Africans were not writing the history that was spread to the masses and public. The East African front is something that’s not commonly spoken about when we talk about WWI. Perhaps it led to more migration to Africans to Europe, leading to discrimination and the inferior look that some European countries have towards Africans.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: I think Jacqueline was first. Go ahead.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jacqueline: This is a really good question, I like the first part. How would Africa have been affected if there had been no European intervention? As Ali said, history is written for those who were there to tell the tale? Would we have less historical documentation of AFrica? I wanted to include that.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Eugene?</p><br>Eugene: Something that I didn’t quite understand was why they were fighting. I get that it was a world war, and it was their colony, I didn’t understand why they were fighting on the African continent. Odd for me. Not sure what that would mean for me. <br>

                    What laid behind Banania poster: Specific Relationship of Senegalese and French<br><br><br>
                    Banania is a popular chocolate drink in France, released in 1912. Its advertising poster changed from a lady in Antilles to a Senegalese infantry’s smiling face in 1915. Although there were proportionately very few ads using Black characters during World War I , how could it retain its popularity? <br><br>
                    On the first hand, it succeeded in gaining economic benefit from black soldiers. Pierre Lardet, the brand founder, distributed the product to the Army with the amount of 14 trucks.  The injured Senegalese infantry was transferred to the rear and was in charge of making Banania at the Courbevoie factory.  Thus, the low production cost and the wide distribution might have been the successful strategy of advertising the product. <br><br>
                    On top of that, since the main target was children, the advertisement image was non-threatening to them, considering the war situation. In World War I, Senegalese soldiers were sent to France to help defend it from German.  The protective aspect of Senegalese soldiers (their bodies serving as a barrier between German soldiers and French) had to be emphasized.  If a white person was served as a model, it would have threatened children because it reminds them of a German.  <br><br>
                    Last but not least, the image entails a positive stereotype of ‘good and innocent colonized’, contrasting with ‘evil colonizer’. In order to bring out familiarity of Senegalese, the soldier in the poster is dressed in a blue uniform and a red hat which was specific to colonized soldiers. Also, the slogan ‘y’ a bon’ was the language for Senegalese soldiers, distinguished from standard language. By stressing the specific features of them, the poster intended to attract French. Going back to the question of the essay, what laid behind the popularity and longevity of Banania poster was the specific relationship between Senegalese and French.  <br><br>

                  <p><b></b></p><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Let’s start with “European views of Africans” and Grace’s question. Grace, could you read your question?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Grace: In this week's readings, Africans are portrayed as an evil people whose true desire is to destroy Europe and its people. What could be the reasons for the switch from previous stereotypes that portrayed them as a race that needed to be guided by Europeans to a threat? (Grace)</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Simena?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: It was unanimous that their presence in Europe changed the perception and that they had access to military power. They had earned their right to invade Europe. They were previously seen as inferior to Europeans, but seeing that they had enough power to march into Europe would have changed the perceptions greatly.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Ali?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: There was, throughout my readings of these texts, I was thinking how much is this racism towards Africans just due to racism and how much is it because of Africans gaining power. I think the perception change is because of how powerful France was and how defeated Germany was. The Germans felt the need to change the blame. They used these prior beliefs about the inferiority of Africans to pass on the blame.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Kevin?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Yeah, so, what I think is that the idea that Africans were a race that needed European guidance and intervention to flourish, it was an idea to justify slavery. This idea that Africans were barbaric, savage, needing to be exposed to European art and ideas, but now, when slavery was much less prominent and viewed as something bad. There’s no longer a need for that kind of rhetoric. There’s a shift in viewpoint and that played a part.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: With that, I think what we want to do is move on to Morel's “Horror on the Rhine.” It's a very specific view of Europeans towards Africans. I’ll ask Rahaa to read his question.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: Earlier, we learned that Morel was a key figure in ending the misrule of King Leopold II in Congo and mitigating the harrowing situation there. Does his stance on the presence of African troops in Rhine taint his position as a champion of human rights? (Rahaa)</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Jusang?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: Well, in the European sense, I don’t think it would. When looking at human rights in general, we’re talking about the rights of every human being from dangers such as oppression, violence, etc. So when Morel was trying to defend the Africans in the Congo Free State he was championing their human rights, also, when the African troops were in the Rhine--you know how Morel uses the argument that the Africans are committing crimes, rapes, against the German population in the Rhine, he condemned them for it, going so far as using racist terminology and slurs against them. In the eyes of many Europeans, I think that would be seen as Morel defending the human rights of the Germans on the Rhine from the Africans, who, in their view, were the oppressors. In that lens, Morel’s position was a champion of human rights, at least within that population.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Morel as a champion? Rahaa?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: I definitely agree that he was viewed as a champion of human rights. These were not Africans, they were African mercenaries. If we saw last week, the images of the cutting of the hands and feet. Those people who were doing all of those atrocities in Africa, they were not Europeans, they were Africans. In the document that we had about Abina, and how they treated women, slave wives and degradation of women in African societies, now these AFricans, very violent men, are entering European cities. Defeated. They have a sense of conquering people, letting their inner demons free, going about the city. I think Morel, in a sense, was right. These African soldiers were former mercenaries, ruthless…</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: I want to ask a question about that. Your argument is that there’s a difference between African mercenaries and African people.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: Morel is focusing his criticism on African soldiers, not African people. Throughout his protest, he emphasizes that he’s not racist. At the beginning, I remember the document that professor Denton raised in the Kakao talk. In one of the documents, it said that he’s “against racism.” He’s part of the left, against racism. The significance of this historical document, at first, seems to be very racist, from a guy who is not expected to be racist. But I think the criticism is not towards the African people. In the documents, one of the arguments is being concerned about the well-being of Africans, in Africa. Colonialism is not going away for a long time, if you create animosity, there will be a backlash against the African people.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: OK, with that, let’s move to Simena.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: I want to add the last point. You’re completely right that it’s not about the African people, it’s about the mercenaries. But when they brought petitions, it was about the African people. It had an impact on Africans living in Europe, despite Morel not intending to tarnish their name.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Grace?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Grace: This is just to add on to Simena’s last comment. One of the sources that one of my groupmates found for the Interactive Paper talked a little bit about some of the residual effects of the German public opinion of the Horror on the Rhine. In the source, it talked about how in February-March 1920 Ray Beveridge gave a series of speeches in Hamburg and Munich decrying the presence of black troops gaining national attention and approbation by exposing the threat of mixed-race children to the purity of the German race.” So I think, like Simena was saying, it may be that Morel was speaking just to the crimes committed by black soldiers, but the public took that and turned that into a feeling of being threatened by the black race as a whole.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Thanks for your input, I’d like to move to the next question.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: Was the blatant racism displayed by figures such as Hitler and Morel mainly for political reasons and to oppose the French in general, or was it primarily due to a belief in superiority over Africans?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Sehwee?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: It’s a mixture of both. There’s a political cause behind the racism and there was racism that was prevalent at the time.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Kevin?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: It’s a recurring trend, how this animosity that people feel towards oppressed races. I think it’s a very human urge to feel or be perceived as oppressed. I think there’s an intrinsic desire in humanity to be the underdog in society, rather than the oppressor. Why are people caring about African people? Why are they not caring for white people? That’s a repeated trend? I think it’s the root cause of Mein Kampf, the desire to be oppressed.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Right, uh, Jana, would you like to add?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jana: Just to add a little, I agree that it could be a mixture of both. But I think it was used jas a manipulation for the population. They needed the guilty and bad people. It’s easier to go to war if there are bad people. Hitler was a manipulator of populations, we don’t know if he really hated them that much, but he used it to create that hate and justify wars.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyong: OK, Zo, you could go next.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Zo: I agree that it’s a mixture of both. But according to them, it’s a problem of morality. The sources state that allowing the Africans into European countries, allowing racial integration is counted as immoral. According to Hitler, he wanted to preserve the Aryan, perfect race, the preservation of the “European perfect race,” is political, but also nationalist.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: OK, cool, Eugene.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Before commenting on that, I think it’s interesting that Hitler is not an integrationist. He’s the opposite of that. There’s a part that he said was a farce that the Christian church wanted to recruit native Africans into Christianity, even as they were condoning secularization of European society. He was commenting on the irony of that. It reminded me of the Jesuits in the aftermath of the Reformation, because they lost Catholic souls, they went to South America to recruit more. I think I saw this pattern in Europeans. They look outside of their territory to solve demographic problems. For example, the trans-Atlantic slave trade or recruiting colonial troops to fight their wars. Hitler isn’t happy about that. I don’t know his true intentions, he wants the missionaries to stop, and saying that what the French were doing was wrong, but his message is clear that Europeans and Africans should be kept separate. I thought that was interesting.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: I think this discussion is moving to a focus on Hitler, but I think we should link it to Africans, let’s move to the next section, and later come back to Morel’s text. Jusang, can you read your question?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: While African troops in the German colonies were praised for their abilities in battle, African troops in Europe were despised later on. How were countries such as Germany able to constantly change the views people had about Africans using race as a criterion?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Simena?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: It’s an issue of benefit. In Africa, they’re fighting their wars for them, but when it turns to a position that harms them, they won’t keep portraying those good views. In my opinion, it’s all a facade. As soon as they gained power and stopped being inferior, that changed.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: They were being used, Kevin?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Interesting how opinion is like a football, being tossed back and forth. Maybe one text praising soldiers is by somebody who’s less racist, and one berating soldiers is by somebody who is more racist. Maybe we’re unsure of the German consensus from these texts. That’s one thing that we should consider.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Sua?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: Keeping Africans as foreigners, as “aliens.” Because at first, when being praised for their abilities, they’re from an African continent and they helped us. But if that status quo remained for a long time, it would have been the case that Africans should be admitted as citizens, so they turned their attitude, thinking that they were disrupting the whole unified society that consisted of “superior races.”&nbsp; That's my thought.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Nabi?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: In my point of view, Germany raised racial issues to benefit their nation. I think they did these kinds of manipulations throughout the world intentionally. I think that they did that successfully, because you can see a wide range of women’s organizations in Italy, Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands, and Sweden, and other countries that demonstrated solidarity with the German nation. That kind of evidence suggests that Germany intentionally promoted those issues.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: I would actually like to move on to Simena’s question about Mein Kampf, but then circle back to the HOrror on the Rhine. Simena?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: In "Mein Kampf", Hitler tries to explain his emphasis on "racial purity" by exemplifying Africans. Are his racist ideas solely based on the hardships Germany faced in the early 20th Century, one of which are "The Horrors on the Rhine", which E. D. Morel elaborates on, for which Hitler and Germans see Africans as the culprit? If so, is he only trying to protect the German nation by imposing actions to purify race and shelter the nation of a population he saw as the issue? Or was he just using a widely accepted stigma within the German population as a front to influence them; and gather followers, namely soldiers, to fight for his aim of German World Domination? It’s kind of long…</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: I wanted to use this question as a way to compare Mein Kampf with the Horrors on the Rhein, to give opinions. If it’s possible, we could simplify this question. Is Horrors on the Rhine an explanation for Mein Kampf? Or is it not a direct consequence? Are they linked to each other?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: I guess what I wanted to say is that it’s objectively bad that he proposed the idea of racial purity, but could there be a motive that he was only trying to protect his nation. I can’t really write it off as objectively bad. After the Versailles Treaty, and everything that Germany had been through, I can see why he didn’t want to side with Europeans, but the way he executed it wasn’t really morally correct.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Rahaa?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: I agree that his idea that the Treaty of Versailles would cause another World War is right. The situation of inflation, the war reparations, there were so many orphans and homeless kids on the streets. People had much difficulty finding a job. I remember watching a German series about this specific period in the Weimar Republic, post WWI, at the beginning, when the Nazi party was gaining support. It explained that Hitler wanted to actually create a sense of social inclusion through exclusion. They were trying to find the reason behind all this misery, and they picked groups like Jews and other races. The situation was really horrible, it did help a lot in Nazis gaining power.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Kevin?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: I do see where Simena’s doubt comes from. Germany was in a bad position, it makes sense that Hitler wanted to improve his country, but the idea of racial purity as improving the situation is very confusing. But I can see where it’s coming from, a place where it’s tempting to place blame on a demographic that isn’t “ours”. Looking for some scapegoat. What I got from Mein Kampf was that he was trying to unite the people against a common enemy, wanted to emphasize solidarity. Maybe that’s what he was trying to achieve through his divisive rhetoric.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Eugene?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: I agree with Simena that he was a manipulator. But coming back to the lack of social unity, maybe the idea of secularization, modernity… but he goes in an illiberal, totalitarian manner. But I can understand why he goes in that direction. But the outcome probably wasn’t the best.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Simena?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: I want to add a final point. I don’t agree with what Hitler did, in any way. There was a social experiment in Germany, made into a movie, showing how easy people are able to be influenced. Hitler made use of a very vulnerable Germany, to push for his own fight, his own cause. Used it as a front to push for his own cause, that’s messed up.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: We’re moving in the direction of HItler’s using African soldiers as a scape-goating material… but first Nabi.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: I noticed that Hitler used this racial issue to show his anger and discrimination against Jews as well. He mentions that it’s the “the Jews who bring the Negroes to the Rhine,” in my view, he wanted to use this situation to show his stance against eh Jews. This benefits his stance, increases his powers.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Annet, can you read your question? I want to circle back to the Horror of the Rhine.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Annet: In The Horror on the Rhine the author points multiple times that the French Army was also formed by a large number of African forces, and the fact that they tried to keep this information hidden from the press. What was the main reason behind this action?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Simena?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: In our current age, I’d say “morality,” but then I think it’s a stigma. It’s not that the French were trying to protect Africans, but a general sense of hatred.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Sehwee?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Nationalism. The French had a lot of pride. A large number of their troops were African, they might lose faith in their army.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Clarification?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Asdf: [Sehwee clarifies]</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Minsoo?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Asdf: I think the reason why they’re not talking about it publicly was because they wanted it to be temporary. In the long term, I think they would have been much more enthusiastic about telling them. Short term agreement, didn’t see the point.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: OK, Jusang?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: One of the motives was to continuously punish the Germans. Didn’t want anybody to condemn them for it. Didn't want to push them too hard. That’s where their interests for taking revenge against Germany overwhelmed these other reasons.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Minsoo, could you read your question?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Minsoo: In Horror on the Rhine, E.D. Morel mentions "the Editors of negro newspapers in the States who attack me". Why do you think people from the US were involved in this conversation? It’s not strictly speaking their problem, so I was curious as to why they were pitching in.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Rahaa?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: This campaign gained a lot of popularity, especially in the US and UK. It compelled the UK prime minister and US president to officially request from the French, to remove the African troops from the Rhineland. They were worried about an arms race or conscripting African troops. What if other European powers were to go in as well and recruit these large numbers of conscripts. This also concerns, at a political level, a global situation. A lot of people in the US immigrated from Germany, felt solidarity with the German people. They wanted to support their own people.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Eugene?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: Why were black Americans interested? It could have been motivated by pan-Africanism, something we saw in that secondary text in the early weeks of this class. African Americans were interested in Africans, a political interest as well as other things. They felt solidarity with the African people that were in Europe. That could have been a reason.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Simena?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: I agree with the points being made and I want to point out something in the second part of the question. I found it interesting that WWI, and the Versailles Treaty, Wilson’s 14 points, the US taking a stance as the world police. For the role to be specifically taken upon by the US president. The US generally, always taking it upon themselves to solve the world’s issues, it’s surprising.</p><br><br>

                  The Unseen Appeals of Hitler’s Texts<br><br><br><br>
                  
                    Hitler’s Mein Kampf is now the subject of condemnation and ridicule due to its abhorrently divisive rhetoric, but what’s interesting to examine is the reason it was able to garner popularity and resonate with thousands of individuals despite its repulsive content. By investigating the reasons of Mein Kampf’s prominence, one can gain insight regarding the root causes of hate and injustice.<br><br>
                  
                    One can observe that Hitler has a tendency to paint himself as an oppressed spiritual pariah who solely is aware of the unsung truths of the world. He directs his vitriol towards the “whole contemporary system ” using acrimonious diction to evoke a strong emotional from the reader. One can infer that Hitler has prioritized optics more than reasoning, his prose more effective in inciting rage towards the world than it is at establishing intelligent theory. The human drive to be perceived as a subjugated, unfairly-treated member of society often precedes logic and reasoning, and it was that drive that Hitler exploited when persuading the audience.<br><br>
                  
                    The depiction of himself and likeminded individuals as a repressed group creates a sense of solidarity, as if imploring the underdogs of society to unite against a common enemy. He writes that “for as long as a people remain racially pure and are conscious of the treasure of their blood, they can never be overcome by the Jew,” illustrating himself as the victim of Jewish brutality, and a martyr to a bloodline inferior to his own. He uses the authority of God to justify the existence of his superior blood, and conversely uses terms such as “satanically” when describing Jewish people. The notion of a “pure” race is scientifically false, yet, idea that one possesses a god-given right simply by existing is certainly a very appealing notion to some.<br><br>

                  <p><b></b></p><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Ali, could you start with your question?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: Senghor's "Prayer To The Masks" shows a sense of African pride throughout the lines. Did the French ever want to erase this African identity and pride that many Africans possessed?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Ali?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: I asked this question because I’m familiar with the concept in NOrth Africa and the way thtat hte French were trying to upset the influence that Africans had already, like in terms of Islam. I was wondering if that same effect was noticed in sub-Saharan Africa, especially because Senghor use these religious themes. Did the French oppose that in any way?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Any more opinions? If not we’ll proceed to the next question. Annet, could you read your question?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Annet: Could the poem Prayer To The Masks be considered a nostalgic lament filled with pride influenced by the racism suffered by Leopold Sedar Senghor during his years of study in France?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Any takers? Kevin?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: This is very nostalgic, filled with pride, a celebration of the African race, a refreshing text in this context. It feels like masks usually have some kind of negative connotation in literature, associated with disingenuousness, or deceit. Maybe, the way I read it, underneath everyone’s masks, people aren’t very different from one another. Discrimination in African states is unjust. In Europe too, where we’re joined by the navel. There’s a filial relationship. Maybe Europe and Africa should be family, instead of what it is now, a critique but also a celebration of African culture and who they are.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you, Ali?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: Senghor, like Kevin said, used this conflict as something that should be avoided. He wants France and Africa’s relations to improve, from Scheck’s article, we can see that Senghor was a very proud African who also felt French. That personality was critical to his writings. It was a really good way to call for an improvement in the relations between France and Africa at that time.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you, Grace?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Grace: I agree with what has been said so far, “a world . . . machines and guns,” the author is remembering traditions that were less practiced, maybe not completely destroyed, but he’s remembering these times when they enjoyed their tribes' traditions. Which relates to Ali’s questions. I don’t know if the French were doing that on purpose, but by including these African people in the war, they took away the opportunity for traditions to be passed down, people were focused on fighting rather than passing down traditions. Maybe that could have been one effect.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Nabi: We’ll now move to Camp 1940, Jessica, could you read your question?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jessica: What might have caused the change in tone of the author Leopold Senghor, between "Camp 1940" and "Prayer to the Masks", the latter being hopeful unlike the former?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Simena?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: I’m not sure if it answers your question, but my interpretation of Prayer to the Masks wasn’t that hopeful. It felt really desperate, pleading to their ancestors. I think it marks the beginning of what’s elaborated more clearly in Camp 1940. What I’m trying to say is that it’s an appeal to the ancestors about what’s being done to them by the colonizers.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: We will move on… wait, Kyeyoung?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: I thought some of the differences between the two were the references to Africa. The part of the secondary source from Professor Scheck, it said about how Senghor, in the prisoner of war camp, was exposed to more Africans, more culturally attached to those traditions. It may have helped him write his poems, not only about the Camp, but also about the masks as well. He started to embrace his identity as an African more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Jacqueline?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jacqueline: I agree about how the tone changed, but the content of both is pretty different. The tone in the poems stem from what Senghor was talking about. In The Prayer to the Masks, he’s talking about African pride in comparison to European pride. But in Camp 1940, he’s talking about the scenery of the African camps. More descriptive sentences. More imagery of the scenery. That influenced the change in tone, when you’re talking about pride, you can’t see with the I, it’s more personal. But in Camp 1940, it’s based on the after effects of war, more somber.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: We’ll move to the Pocket Guide. Would anybody like to start the discussion on this topic?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Should I read my question?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Yes, please read your question.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: Considering the racial discrimination at the time, would it be realistic for the US military to be respectful towards Africans?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Anybody want to start?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: When reading the document, I wasn’t thinking about hte US. But that they kept the Africans separate, they had more respect for them than the Africans in the US. It’s realistic, because it’s based on lack of knowledge.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you, Ali?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: In addition to what Simena just said, it felt to me from the tone that it wasn’t pure respect, it was a fact of trying to unify people for this one cause. Trying to win the war at that time. Not sure how the interactions of American soldiers with Africans went in Africa. They had to respect them to not cause conflict with an ally at that time.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Jusang?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: I want to agree with what Ali said and build on his point. He says “an African who is an enemy is useless and dangerous.” These native Africans here are to be approached as potential allies, but nothing much else. There’s this tone, of because we’re here, we might as well make them an ally. It’s not genuine acceptance and respect. It says, “Everybody is entitled to their own prejudices.” You can believe what you want, but just don’t show it to them.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Let’s go to Jusang’s question.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: Did the US military view Africans more as "allies" in the form of extra menial labor, or did they view them as diplomatic and intellectual allies?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Who would like to start, Simena?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: Neither. It’s a basic form of teamwork rather than seeing them as intellectual allies. If they have to point out that they’re the same… but I’m not sure that they degrade them enough to see them in the form of extra menial labor.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you, Sua?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: I think political interests joined them mainly. A century earlier, they saw them as inferior, seeing them as allies now. Politically they need them. For that, they’re seemingly describing Africans as equal.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you, Rahaa?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: I don’t think Americans needed these Africans for menial laborers, this is the 20th century. This is after the industrial revolution. What’s important here is free trade. They didn’t want to alienate these people. It was mentioned about these African ports, in the war effort, ships are going everywhere. They’re helping the war effort, even as far as Russia. What they wanted was less menial labor or intellectual allies, but an economic decision to respect these people and use their ideal geo-political location. In the future th8ey can sell their own goods to these people.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you, Manseok?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Maneseok: I agree with Simena. In the Pocket Guide, it shows respect to their allies in the section, “Things not to do,” but the tone, “African enemies are useless and dangerous.” It seems like “one-time teamwork.”&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you</p><br><p dir="ltr">Denton: Before we move on, any guesses about these authors?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Rahaa?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: Reminds me of Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People, white, middle class, business influence. That’s my guess.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Grace?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Grace: It seems to me that the authors, at least one of them, had to have lived in parts of Africa for a good amount of time. They seem that they’re familiar with the pace of life over there, they have a lot of insights into why they do some things. Lived there as a soldier stationed there, maybe a missionary? Ambassadors at the time? That could be a possibility?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Sehwee?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: I think that the people who usually write these things about native people, and are respectful, are missionaries because they’re trying to blend into society. I think both are missionaries. But I'm not sure what religion, since they’re American, maybe not CAtholic?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you, Jusang?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: I’m not too sure about both. But I think that one might be a high-ranking military person, a platoon commander with a long history of being sent to different parts of Africa, local chiefs, signing treaties, that kind of background would have given them a lot of knowledge. Especially if they were signing treaties, that might give them expertise on that regard. They might also be non-Americans, maybe Europeans? Those who would have a larger foothold on Africa, maybe it was inserted into the guide.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Any more takers to the professor’s question?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: I think everyone had good points. I think it’s a high-ranking official in the US war and navy departments. “Do not belittle their Gods, their God is as real as our God is to us.” They do talk about how we need to respect women, because they have their own husbands. Maybe they care about family? Married? With children? Could be a woman… If somebody tells you to respect women, that person, at that time, isn’t usually a man.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Denton: [intervening..]</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Grace?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Grace: Could be teachers, in Africa, would have given access to daily lifestyles and habits. Maybe watching children? My guess.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Jusang?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: After hearing what Professor Denton said, could there be a possibility that one of the authors is native American, or an indigenous American, they had their own religions and cultures, experience of being suppressed by a foreign power in their own land. Maybe a similar viewpoint. Especially the respect for cultural and religious norms, as well as the politics.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Kyeyoung?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: Maybe this is more of a conservative guess, repeating to what others said. There’s also a possibility that they were anthropologists… soldiers recruited them.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Denton: [Explanation of the authors]</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: We’ll move on to the Brazzaville speech. Simena, could you read your question?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: What could have influenced Charles de Gaulle to attend a support conference for French colonial subjects in Africa?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Any takers? Rahaa?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: At that period, the French were anticipating an international tribunal that would decide the future of their colonies, so they decided to go forward and do this themselves, give Africans more rights. At the same time, they could have rejected the idea of independence for the colonies. The reason was to prevent an international tribunal in which other countries decided about the fate of French colonies overseas. The brief research I did on these documents, Stalin, at the Tehran conference in 1943 said “I don’t want to fight so that France can have Indochina back.” Franklin D Roosevelt said, “ I agree with Marshal STalin 100%” French colonial rule in INdochina made the situation a lot worse over the past 100 years. They held this conference to avoid a tribunal.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Ali?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: I wasn’t aware of this background context that Rahaa provided, it’s great, but from the secondary source I found, I saw that it was a focal point in de Gaulle’s effort to build Free France. He wasn’t seeking after power or personal glory, he wanted to do this for France and the Brazzaville conference was an important part of that.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Rahaa, can you read your question?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: What were the reasons behind France's change of approach in her colonial policies in the Brazzaville's conference? Some of the points included in the Brazzaville's Declaration: 1. Citizens of France's colonies would share equal rights with French citizens. 2.Citizens of French colonies would have the right to vote for the French parliament.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Any opinions? Simena?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: The previous answers provide good examples for this. BEsides from that, a lot of empires were falling. Many were afraid of losing their empire, which is why they’d do anything to keep it as one. They didn’t want to lose their empire, which is why they were willing to give their colonial subjects equal rights.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you, Rahaa?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: I would like to point out the role of US hegemony, which they gained after WWII, they were very much against colonialism. All the children were taught that the US was born against the colonial British empire. Americans were in support of free trade, and the other empires (like the French), had autaky and imperial trade preferences, they wanted to keep the trade inside their own empire and impose high tariffs with people who wanted to do business with their colonies. I think de Gaulle was under pressure from the US. The Free France heavily relied on its US ally to free the metropole from German occupation, so he was under immense pressure to effect some change.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you, Sua?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: Adding to what Rahaa said, I agree, but I’m not sure if I can put it this way, there was an international ideological trend… this speech was in 1944, it’s before the end of WWII. Maybe the French thought that Germany was far from winning the war and they thought that to keep their stable position in international relationships, they needed to accept equal status, that it would help them.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you, let’s move to the next section. Grace, could you read your question?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Grace: In Aime Cesaire's "Discourse on Colonialism," the author addresses the "dishonest equations" that Christianity and paganism determine whether a society is civilized or not. Bringing back earlier weeks' readings, some explorers encountered parts of Africa that accepted Christianity and recorded these cases. Considering this history, do you think that Cesaire's assessment of the cause of European views on civilization is correct?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Any takers? Simena?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: I wasn’t aware that there were Christians in Africa. But something that I sw in Christainity being used as a means to spread innovation. I think it’s a control mechanism. It doesn’t boil down to somebody having correct views on religion. The Europeans see themselves as having a more superior stance, they want to spread that to control people and give their rule a sense of legitimacy, that something materialistic couldn’t give.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Thank you, Kevin?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: This idea that Christianity could help Africans, I think it was pretty popular, the idea that spreading it was an act of philanthropy. Christianity was kind of associated with higher literacy rates. To practice Christniaty, you have to understand scripture. FAulty reasoning that Christinaity is the basis of “civilization,” condescending and patronizing. I can understand why Cesaire has issues with it.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: Ali?&nbsp;</p><br>Ali: What’s interesting, is that it’s not just Christianity. Professor Scheck talked about how they used propaganda to recruit Muslim soldiers in the Second World War. It has lessened over the years, but this idea of religion equalling civilization, and therefore opposing others with different religious beliefs. Cesaire’s analysis is correct.<br>

                  A Cry for Union<br><br><br><br>
                  Nigritude (Négritude) was a unifying poetic, and political movement appeared in the 1930. This was supported by many writers such as Leopold S. Senghor, author of Prayer to the Masks. Here the author express what seems to be a nostalgic call for the spirits and ancestors that use to be next to him in his land but not anymore. In this poem, as in many other pieces of the moment, Africans would express common experiences had during colonialism in search for re-connect with their roots. Racial discrimination was common at the time, but trough this movement that black people found the force to be proud of their blackness and accept their cultural identity. But “Negritude, far from isolating black peoples in difference, is a step towards the convergence of all civilizations” . The philosophy behind it was to recognize the value of African contributions, not just for themselves, but for the world. It was not an anti-racism racist movement, but one base in Marxism. Europe was changing around this time, and so was Africa. The ones that once use their arms against blacks to steal their land and resources were now offering them and asking for help to protect their own. But for those who fought a war that was not theirs and stayed overseas, this movement would bring them home. Negritude was a cry against assimilation, against losing their identity, and alerting of the not so clear consequences of colonialism. What may seem like a cultural thing would influence and help millions, even in our current times. Nigritude achieved a sense of pride for being something that was being discriminated and judged at the time, demonstrating the power and influence of words

                  <p><b></b></p><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: Let’s start with changing attitudes about colonialism, we’re going to break or discussion up into preconditions, proximate causes and precipitants. Sua, could you read your question?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: Could it be said that modern concepts of human rights were fully accepted only after two World Wars and the sacrifices of Africans? Or was the acceptance only due to political interest? What does this history (of World Wars and colonization) indicate to us living in 21st century?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: Sehwee?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sehwee: [need to add from the recording]</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: Yeah, right, perhaps these tragedies bring the people of the world closer to each other. Kevin, go ahead.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: I definitely see where this question is coming from. Historically, even today, violent events, or displays of barbarism or inhumanity have been a catalyst for an increased awareness of human rights. It may be so that war initiated this movement. This exhibition of cruelty was a wake-up call for people caring about human rights. I think it’s a natural human progression that humanity grows more human as civilization advances. Humans become more human, that’s what I think. It may just be organic progression, an elevation of a human sense of morality.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa:&nbsp; Jusang, go ahead.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: For me, besides political interests and the two bloody wars, there’s the progression of time itself. Europeans have been controlling Africa for hundreds of years. That gave time for Africans to distinguish themselves within colonial society. Like Senghor, as a poet and politicians. By this point, the European populations are realizing that the native populations that they have control over are becoming more aware. So just the passage of time in general and the increased rate of development… that would have spurred this new desire for human rights. By then the leaders might have viewed the spread of human rights as inevitable.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: Kevin, would you read your question from last week?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: My question is “What is the relationship between Christianity and colonization? Why was Christianity associated with civilization?”</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa:&nbsp; Ali, go ahead.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: The way I view it, I’m not familiar with the Christian religion and its beliefs, but just the fact that it’s the dominant religion in Europe and a way to separate their own monotheistic beliefs and African animistic beliefs, which they saw as paganistic and inferior. It was a way to separate Europeans and Africans.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa:&nbsp; Annet, go ahead.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Annet: I thoroughly agree with Ali. Europeans used Christianity as a justification to exploit and psychologically control Africans, because they didn’t know much. It was a justification that Europeans used.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa:&nbsp; Thank you, Simena. Go ahead.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: I agree with what was previously said, I thou9gh8t about the principles of Christianity and the concept of Jesus Christ sacrificing himself for people’s sins. I think they adapted this moral obligation--the concept of rid someone of wrong-doing of sins, paganism--pushed them to taking Christianity and moral right to people around the world.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa:&nbsp; But also verses in the Bible, proponents of slavery in the United States would use those Bible verses to perpetuate slavery, justification of segregation. Some doctrines in Christianity that support slavery. Grace, go ahead.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Grace: First, to add to what you said. There’s two different ways that slavery is talked about in the Bible. Old Testament, indentured servitude, 7 years then released, then in the New Testament, talking about the specific situation of Romans over the Israelites, in servitude, that they were to obey their masters. Could be used as justifications for a lot of things that were allowed at that time. I also think that the divine right to rule played into this association, mostly Emperors that were “blessed with rule,” that spread to nations and their right to be above other people.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: Thank you.&nbsp; Sua, go ahead.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Asdf: I agree with the points made, but I think Christianity itself is an exclusionary religion. If you don’t believe in the same God, you’re encouraged to believe in the same God. I think religion itself, as a factor, imposes some social norms on its members. If you don’t believe then you’re a problematic citizen. Religion imposes normality, leading to colonization and civilization.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa:&nbsp; Let’s move to the next question, Jacqueline?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jacqueline: Why did the Africans have to be the ones to enact political change to stifle European colonialism? If not for the All-African People's Conference, would Europeans have decolonized Africa on their own will?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa:&nbsp; Simena?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: I think no. There would have been no benefit to them having the independence of colonial subjects. There were things in the document that implied that the Belgians moving out of the region, taking government and infrastructure with them, made it very difficult for them to become independent. They fought against it and didn’t want them to be independent.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa:&nbsp; Jessica?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Asdf: [missed the first part…] but I think that when there’s no Africans voluntary effort, I still think that the Europeans would have decolonized because of the international movement against it, like the UN or the US or the Soviet Union. They had positive support for Africans to decolonize and gain human rights. So they might have suffered from some international suppression.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: That’s definitely true, but at the same time, as Simena said, we have these European countries that want to continue exploiting their former colonies. US hegemony and support for decolonization made discord between US and their allies, even during WWII. Eugene?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: I want to point out that a lot of these concepts that fueled decolonization, are Western, or sometimes Leninist concepts, like “self-determination” or “ethno-nationalism.” And regarding what people said about religion, how they took that religion and how it was used… could say a lot of the same thing about Islam. The internal motivation is a separate question.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa:&nbsp; Zo?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Zo: After WWII, the notion of human rights was becoming widespread, the emergence of the United Nations, motivated the Africans to step up for themselves. Without all these events coming together, I don’t think they would have opposed colonialism. Europeans had to face this new perspective of the world.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa:&nbsp; Thank you, let’s move on to the next question, Jusang, could you elaborate on “neo-colonialism”?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Jusang: I was talking about how directly after WWII, other foreign powers like the US, involved themselves in the region, if that helps with the question: “Would you say that the measures that were taken by the Congo to eliminate neo-colonialism from the country were ultimately successful? Why did you choose such an answer?”&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa:&nbsp; Simena, go ahead.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Simena: I think you answered your own question with your answer. I think the US and Soviets were not part of the neo-colonialism, but maybe the Belgian, the measures they took were in response to the UN. That was an invitation for the US and Soviet Union to have another battlefield of the Cold War. A smaller issue that led to a bigger issue. Unsuccessful in this.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa:&nbsp; Thank you, any other takers? If not, let’s move on to proximate causes. Minsoo, can you read your question?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Minsoo: In his speech, Lumumba said, "we will then send the best of our sons abroad to learn, so that in five years the Congo may have its own technicians in every field." Do you think that in the period after colonization, certain fields develop faster than others and if so why? By fields I mean medicine, arts, social sciences, things like that.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa:&nbsp; Any takers, Nabi?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Nabi: It was critical for the Congo to educate the population, during the colonial period, the people that lived in the Congo didn’t know how to produce particular products from natural resources. I think that it would be really necessary and an important step to organize particular systems for the Congolese to go abroad and get an education, to change everything necessary to make the economy prosper. This impact is an effective step, because in my country there are already some programs that allow people to get education and then come back. It’s a critical step.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa:&nbsp; Thank you, ali?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Ali: I agree with what Nabi said, and talking about Africa, there were improvements in different scientific and cultural fields after decolonization because education is open to more people. That has brought improvement. I do believe that the spread of idea, more Africans writing these primary source documents, Cesaire, Lumumba, this African perspective has helped develop these sciences and humanities worldwide.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa:&nbsp; True, these African intellectuals educated in European countries, the colonial metropoles, developing these ideas for independence and decolonization. Sua, would you go ahead?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Sua: Certain fields developed to restore the prosperity that had crashed because of the two world wars. The Cold War came quickly, and the development of fields was enhanced because of the competition between ideologies. Those nations had to prove that communism or capitalism was better. Some fields were promoted to develop, more than others.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa:&nbsp; Thank you, Kevin?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kevin: Yeah, I definitely think being colonized stunts the development of colonization. Contrary to the idea of Christianity as a precedent for civilization. I don’t agree with that sentiment. It hinders progress. It’s difficult to progress if your people are being exploited by other countries. Devastating effect on morale. In terms of the Congo, the natural resources are getting exploited by foreign nations.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa:&nbsp; Thank you, Eugene?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Eugene: I think Kevin raises a really good point about colonialism and how it could, maybe not have positive outcomes for the people, but at the same time, it’s interesting to point out how a lot of African countries crashed after colonialism. The premise was that not being colonized was that they would develop exponentially, I think people forgot some things along the way. Veering in an extreme opposite direction, changing things radically, forgetting the past contexts can be just as harmful. There are some realistic things that you have to consider. If you say that all colonialism and its consequences are evil, it’s hard to explain Western governmental systems and technology. If you want to go to precolonial, you have to deny these things. Nuance is really important.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa: I definitely agree and it segues nicely to our next question, Kyeyoung?&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr">Kyeyoung: How would you characterize Lumumba? What are his positives and negatives?</p><br><p dir="ltr">Rahaa:&nbsp; In 1950, the GDP per capita which roughly indicates the standard of living, DRC ranked 44th, better standard of living in the DRC than China. Today, the GDP per capita, nationmaster.com, DRC, close to 180th. A freefall.&nbsp;</p><br>Kyeyoung: A flaw in the reasoning. Averages. [add the missing parts.<br>

                  Congo Independence Disrupted by Ideological Intervention<br><br><br><br>
                  
                  In the aftermath of the Second World War, in which bloody sacrifices that has arisen from political and ideological conflicts swept away, many countries in African continent that had been colonized since the Westerners’ exploration claimed for their independence. Democratic Republic of Congo, one of those countries that wanted independence, went thorough a devastating political conflict so-called ‘Congo Crisis.’ Patrice Lumumba, the leading figure of the Congo independence movement, strongly went against the independence movement of Katanga from Congo. It may seem questionable, even self-contradictory that a formerly colonized country suppressing their province’s desire to become free.<br><br>
                  There may exist some spots that allows the interpretation of Lumumba’s rejection to Katanga independence as self-contradiction. In his speech, Lumumba implicitly draws a line between “we,” who are “honest” and not having the greed “to sell our country out, [and] to get money from imperialists,” and “those who want to ” It may even seem that he uses African identity and solidarity to support himself and gain political advocacy, in that he announces “we are simply Africans,” again emphasizing the communal identity of “we” in contrast to the ones scheming Katanga independence. <br><br>
                  However, when understanding the two independence movements in different context, we may find that the foremost problem underlies not in Lumumba nor Tschombe, but the disruption of their movements as ideology war. While the independence movement of Congo from Belgium started as an escape from colonization, with the intervention of Soviet Union and United States, the independence movement has shifted to war of ideas, disrupted as a dichotomous definition of capitalism or communism. This intervention of powerful nations in African affairs may even be said as a clandestine form of social Darwinism, regarding that Africans cannot handle their problems on their own but needs Westerners’ arbitration.
